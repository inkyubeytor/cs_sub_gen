The legal defense of set-off ( above ) was originally introduced to prevent the unfair halaat whereby a vyakti ( `` party a '' ) jo owed dhan to another ( `` party b '' ) could be bheja to karjadaar thana, despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A.
The law yun allows dono partiyon to taalna bhugtan jabatak unke sambandhit claims have been heard in court.
Upon judgment, both claims are buje or replaced by a single jaal yoga owing ( e.g. if party a owes party b 100 or party b owes party a 105, the do rakam hai niyat band and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A ).
Set-off can also be incorporated by contractual anubandh so ki, jahaan a party moolbhoot, the paraspar amounts owing hai automatically set off and extinguished.
In certain jurisdictions ( including the uk ), set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company.
This means that, liye prayek party jisase is dono a creditor or debtor of the insolvent company, paraspar debts hai set-off viruddh prayek anya, or tab either the diwalia 's creditor can arji the santulan in the diwaliyapan or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid, depending on which side owed the most.
This has been criticized as an undeclared suraksha byaaj ki violates the principle of pari passu.
The alternative, where a creditor rai to adaa sab iske debts, lakin praapt tabhi a simit portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get, poses the danger of 'knock-on ' insolvencies.
The right to set off is particularly important when reporting a bainko 's vikiranon to niamak adhikariyon.
The situation where a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower ( and is therefore exposed, because there is a risk that the borrower might difolt thereby agrani to the ghaataa of the bainko 's or iske jamakartaon ' dhan ) is yun replaced ( jahaan the bainko rai liya suraksha over saajha or pratibhuti of the borrower ) saath an expozar of the money lent minus the value of the security taken.

( Cats and dogs can not synthesize vitamin d efficiently or jarur praapt it in unke diet. )
An organic rasinic yogic ( or sambandhit niyat of yogicon ) is tabhi scientifically pukaara a vitamin jab it can nahin be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must be obtained from their diet.
However, as with other compounds commonly pukaara vitamin, vitamin d thi khoja in an praytn to dhundhen the dietary padaarth ki thi lacking in a beemaari, namely, rickets, the childhood form of osteomalacia.
Additionally, like other compounds called vitamins, in the viksit sansar vitamin d is added to stepal bhojan, aise as milk, to avoid beemaari due to kamiyaan.
Measures of serum levels reflect endogenous synthesis from exposure to dhoop as khub as seven isse the aahaar, or it is believed ki sanshleshan may yogadan generally to the mentanence of paryaapt serum ekaagratha.
The evidence indicates that the sanshleshan of vitamin d isse surya expozar works in a pratikriya loop ki roktaa toxicity lakin, kuki of anischitata parichay the karkat risk from sunlight, no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine, USA, for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D requirements.
Accordingly, the Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin d assume ki no sanshleshan occurs or ki sab of a vyakti 's vitamin d is isse unke diet, although that will rarely occur in practice.
In the liver vitamin D is converted to calcidiol, jisase is bhi gyaat as calcifediol ( in ), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D—abbreviated 25 ( OH ) D ; and which is the specific vitamin D metabolite that is measured in serum to determine a person 's vitamin D status.
Part of the calcidiol is converted by the kidneys to calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D. calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the rakt, regulating the visheshgyata of calcium or phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone.
calcidiol is bhi parivartit to calcitriol baahar of the gurde liye anya uddeshy, aise as the aprasar, differentiation and apoptosis of cells ; calcitriol also affects neuromuscular function and inflammation.
Beyond its use to prevent osteomalacia or rickets, the pramaan liye anya swasthya prabhaav of vitamin d supplementation in the general population is inconsistent.
The best evidence of laabh is liye asthi swasthya or a ghati in mortality in elderly women.
Standard form of the aavadhik talika.
The colors represent different shrenee of tatv samajhaayaa neeche.
The periodic table is a tabular display of the rasinic tatv, vyavasthit on the aadhaar of unke parmaanu sankhyaayein, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties.
Elements hai prastut in anukram of increasing parmaanu kramank ( number of protons ).
The standard form of table comprises an 18 × 7 grid or pramukh deh of tatv, positioned upar a smaller double row of elements.
the talika can bhi be deconstructed into chaar ytaakar block : the s-block to the baayein, the p-block to the sahi, the d-block in the middle, and the f-block below that.
The rows of the table are called periods ; the columns of the s-, d-, or p-blocks hai pukaara samooh, saath kuch of ye having names aise as the hellogence or the noble gases.
Since, by definition, a periodic table incorporates recurring trends, any such table can be used to derive sambandh between the gun of the tatv or bhavishyavaanee the gun of nai, yet to be khoja or synthesized, tatv.
As a result, a periodic table—whether in the maanak rup or kuch anya variant—provides a upyogi fremawork liye analyzing rasinic bartaav, or aise teble hai widely prayukt in chemistry and other sciences.
Although precursors exist, Dmitri Mendeleev is generally credited saath the prakaashan, in 1869, of the pehla widely recognized periodic table.
He developed uske talika to illustrate aavadhik rujhaan in the gun of the then-known elements.
mendeleev bhi purvanumanit kuch gun of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table.
Most of his predictions were proved correct jab the tatv in sawaal yahood subsequently khoja.
Mendeleev 's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further nai tatv or the vikaas of nai saidhantik model to bataaiye rasinic bartaav.
All elements from parmaanu sankhyaayein 1 ( hydrogen ) to 118 ( ununoctium ) have maharoom discovered or synthesized.
the tatv isse 1 to 98 ( californium ) have maharoom mila to maujuud naturally, haalanki kuch hai mila tabhi in trace amounts and were initially discovered by synthesis in laboratories.
The elements baad 98 have tabhi maharoom synthesized in laboratories.
Production of elements beyond ununoctium is hone dhada, saath the sawaal of kaisaa the aavadhik talika may need to be modified to accommodate any such additions being a matter of ongoing debate.
numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring tatv have bhi maharoom utpaadit in laboratories.

The most familiar example is a voice band modem that turns the digital data of a personal computer into modulated vidyut signal in the awaz aavriti dayera of a telephone channel.
These signals can be transmitted over telephone linon or demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data.
Modems are generally classified by the amount of data they can send in a given unit of time, praayah expressed in bits prati duusari ( bit/s, or bps ), or bits prati duusari ( B/s ).
Modems can alternatively be vargeekrut by unke pratik rate, measured in baud.
The baud ikai denotes pratikon prati duusari, or the kramank of times per second the modem sends a new signal.
liye udhaaharan, the itu v.21 maanak prayukt audio aavriti shift keying saath do sambhavit barambharataa corresponding to two distinct symbols ( or one bit per symbol ), to carry 300 bits per second using 300 baud.
By contrast, the original ITU V.22 standard, which was able to transmit and receive four distinct pratikon ( do bits prati pratik ), sambhala 1,200 bit/s by sending 600 pratikon prati duusari ( 600 baud ) using phase shift keying.

Many people were shaamil in the avishkaar of radio as we abhi know it.
Several possible methods of wireless communication were considered, including inductive or capacitive preran or hastantaran through the maidan, however the vidhi prayukt liye radio aaj exclusively involves the hastantaran or resepshan of electromagnetic waves.
After jaldi atakalein on the vishay, praayogic kaary on the conection between vidyut or chumbakatv began around 1820 saath the work of Hans Christian Ørsted and continued with the work of André-Marie Ampère, Joseph Henry, and Michael Faraday.
These investigations culminated in the puraa siddhanth of vidyutchumbakatv viksit by james Clerk Maxwell.
This siddhanth varnit the saidhantik aadhaar of the propagation of electromagnetic waves.
After maxwell 's siddhanth thi prakashit anek logon experimented saath betaar communication, some intentionally using Maxwell 's theory some not.
It is considered likely that the first intentional transmission of a signal by arthath of electromagnetic lehren thi performed by daud edward hughes around 1880, haalanki is thi mana to be preran at the time.
The first systematic and unequivocal transmission of EM lehren thi performed by heinrich rudolph hertz or varnit in papers prakashit in 1887 or 1890.
Hertz famously mana ye parinaam as hone of choti practical value.
After Hertz 's work many people were involved in the development of components and siddhanth shaamil saath the hastantaran or resepshan of electromagnetic waves.
Others, notably Guglielmo marconi, yahood chintit saath vyaavhaarik sudhaar or the vanijyik anuprayog of radio to betaar telegraphy.
baad on reginald A. fessenden became the pehla to bhejein an audio signal by arthath of electromagnetic waves.
Scurvy is a beemaari resulting isse a kamiyaan of vitamin c, jisase is jaruri for the synthesis of collagen in humans.
The chemical name for vitamin C, ascorbic acid, is derived from the Latin naam of scurvy, scorbutus, jisase bhi provides the kriyasheel scorbutic ( `` of, characterized by or having to do with scurvy '' ).
Scurvy often presents itself initially as lakshan of malaise or lethargy, followed by gathan of dhabbe on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding from the mucous membranes.
Spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a vyakti saath the ailment looks paale, feels udhaas, or is partially immobilized.
As scurvy advances, there can be open, suppurating wounds, ghaataa of daant, pilia, fever, neuropathy or maut.
Scurvy was at ek samay aam among sailors, pirates or anya savaar jahaajon at samudr longer than perishable fal or subjiyan could be bhandaarit ( subsisting bajaay tabhi on cured and salted meats and dried grains ) and by soldiers similarly deprived of these foods for extended periods.
It was described by hipocratis ( c. 460 bc–c. 380 bc ), or herbal cures liye scurvy have maharoom gyaat in many native cultures since prehistory.
Scurvy was one of the limiting factors of samudri safar, praayah hatya vishaal sankhyaayein of the yatri or kru on long-distance voyages.
This became a significant issue in Europe from the beginning of the aadhunik era in the aayu of discovery in the 15th sadi, continuing to play a significant role through World War I in the 20th century.
While today scurvy is known to be caused by a nutritional deficiency, until the isolation of vitamin c or sidhaa pramaan of iske kadi to scurvy in 1932, numerous theories or upachaar yahood prastaavit, often on little or no experimental data.
This inconsistency is attributed to the lack of vitamin c as a pruthak avadharana, an aakshamata to reliably kadi alag bhojan ( notably upasthit in bhais citrus, watercress, and organ meat ) to scurvy.
An additional concept required to understand scurvy thi the degradation of vitamin c by expozar to air or tambe or anya parivartan metal lavan aise as those of aayran, yun badalanaa the kadi of bhojan to scurvy over time.
upachaar by bhais khaanaa, visheshkar citrus fal, thi periodically implemented, as it had been since antiquity.
However jabatak the 1930s, upachaar thi asangat, saath anek aprabhavi treatments used into the 20th century.
It was a Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind who first proved it could be treated saath citrus fal in prayog he varnit in uske 1753 kitaab, a treatise of the scurvy, haalanki uske salaah thi nahin implemented by the royal navy liye anek decades.
In infants, scurvy is sometimes referred to as barlow 's beemaari, namit baad sar thomas barlow, a angrejon chikitsak jo varnit it.
However, Barlow 's disease may bhi refer to mitral valve prolapse.
Other eponyms liye scurvy shaamil moeller 's beemaari and Cheadle 's disease.
Scurvy does not occur in most animals because ve can synthesize unke apana vitamin C.
However, humans and other higher primates ( the simians - bandaron or apes - or tarsiers ), gini boar, sabase or sab bats, or kuch prajati of pakshiyon or machhlee kami an anzime ( l-gulonolactone oxidase ) jaruri liye such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet.
vitamin c is faili in sanyantr utakon, saath visheshkar unchi ekaagratha occurring in citrus fruits ( oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits ), tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages, and green peppers.
Iron is a chemical element with the pratik fe ( isse ) or parmaanu kramank 26.
It is a metal in the pehla parivartan shrenee.
It is the most common element ( by mass ) forming the planet Earth as a puure, forming much of dharti 's bahari or bhitari kor.
It is the fourth most common tatv in the dharti 's crust.
Iron 's very common presence in rocky grah jaise dharti is due to iske abundant utpaadan as a parinaam of sanlayan in high-mass sitaron, jahaan the utpaadan of nickel-56 ( jisase decays to the sabase aam samasthanik of aayran ) is the last nuclear fusion reaction that is exothermic.
is kalyankari radioskriy nikal to become the pichhlaa tatv to be utpaadit pehle patan of a supernova leads to the explosive events that scatter this precursor radionuclide of iron abundantly into space.
Like other group 8 elements, iron exists in a wide range of oxikaran rajya, −2 to +6, haalanki +2 or +3 hai the sabase aam.
Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids or anya kam oxigen environments, lakin is reactive to oxygen and water.
Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, lakin oxidize in saamaanya air to de hydrated aayran oxide, commonly known as rust.
Unlike many other metals which rup passivating oxide paraton, aayran oxide occupy adhik awaz than iron metal, and thus iron oxides flake off and expose fresh surfaces for corrosion.
Iron metal rai maharoom prayukt chunki pracheen times, haalanki tambe alloys, jisase have lower melting temperatures, were used first in history.
Pure iron is naram ( softer than aluminium ), lakin is unobtainable by smelting.
The material is significantly hardened or strengthened by impurities isse the smelting prakram, such as carbon.
A certain proportion of carbon ( between 0.002 % or 2.1 % ) produces steel, jisase may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron.
crude aayran metal is utpaadit in dhamaakaa furnaces, jahaan ayask is ghataya by coke to suar aayran, which has a high carbon content.
Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon saamagree to the sahi proportion to mek steel.
Steels and low carbon iron alloys with other metals ( alloy steels ) are by far the sabase aam dhaatuon in audyogic upyog, due to unke great dayera of vaanchhneeya gun or the prachurtaa of aayran.
Iron chemical compounds, jisase shaamil amishrit or ferric yogicon, have many uses.
aayran oxide mishrit saath aluminium powder can be ignited to create a thermite reaction, used in welding and purifying ores.
It forms binary compounds with the hellogence or the chalcogens.
Among its organometallic yogicon is ferrocene, the pehla sandwich yogic khoja.
Iron plays an important role in jeevigyaan, forming devalayas saath aanvik oxigen in haemoglobin or myoglobin ; ye do yogicon hai aam oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates.
aayran is bhi the metal prayukt at the kriyasheel sait of anek mahatvapurn radox anzimon dealing saath cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.
