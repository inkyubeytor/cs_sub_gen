the vidhik raksha of set-off ( above ) thi originally introduced to prevent the anyaaypurna situation whereby a person ( `` Party a '' ) jo owed money to another ( `` Party B '' ) could be bheja to karjadaar thana, despite the fact ki Party b bhi owed dhan to party A.
the vidhi thus allows dono partiyon to defer bhugtan jabatak their respective claims have been heard in adaalat.
upon nirnay, dono claims hai buje or replaced by a single jaal yoga owing ( e.g. If party A owes party b 100 or party B owes Party a 105, the do rakam hai niyat band or replaced with a single daayitv of 5 from Party B to party a ).
Set-off can bhi be incorporated by contractual anubandh so ki, jahaan a party defaults, the mutual amounts owing hai automatically niyat band or extinguished.
in nishchit jurisdictions ( including the UK ), set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company.
This arthath ki, liye prayek party which is dono a creditor or debtor of the insolvent company, paraspar debts hai set-off viruddh prayek anya, and tab either the bankrupt 's creditor can arji the santulan in the diwaliyapan or the trustee in diwaliyapan can pucho for the balance baaki to be sashulk, depending on jisase paksh owed the sabase.
is has maharoom criticized as an undeclared security byaaj that violates the principle of pari passu.
The alternative, jahaan a creditor rai to adaa sab iske debts, but praapt tabhi a simit portion of the leftover moneys ki other unsecured lendaaron milengi, poses the danger of 'knock-on ' insolvencies.
the sahi to niyat band is visheshkar important when reporting a bainko 's vikiranon to regulatory authorities.
the situation jahaan a bainko rai to rapat ki it rai lent a vishaal yoga to a borrower ( and is therefore exposed, kuki there is a risk ki the borrower might difolt thereby agrani to the loss of the bainko 's or iske depositors ' dhan ) is yun replaced ( jahaan the bank rai taken suraksha over shares or pratibhuti of the borrower ) saath an expozar of the dhan lent rin the value of the suraksha liya.

vitamin d is a samooh of fat-soluble secosteroids jimmedaar liye intestinal avasorana of calcium or phosphate.
In humans, the most important sambandhit yogicon of vitamin D are vitamin d2 and vitamin d3.
Cholecalciferol ( vitamin d3 ) or ergocalciferol ( vitamin d2 ) hai adwitiya as ve constitute kayaa we know as vitamin D or can be ingested isse the aahaar and/or supplements.
the deh can bhi synthesize vitamin D ( from cholesterol ) jab sun exposure is paryaapt ( hence iske upnaam, the `` sunshine vitamin '' ).
haalanki vitamin d is commonly called a vitamin, it is not darasal an anivaary dietary vitamin in the strict bhav, as it can be synthesized in paryaapt amounts by sabase mammals exposed to dhoop.
( Cats or kutto can nahin synthesize vitamin d efficiently or jarur praapt it in unke aahaar. )
an sashulk rasinic yogic ( or sambandhit niyat of yogicon ) is only scientifically called a vitamin when it can nahin be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, or must be praapt isse unke aahaar.
however, as saath other yogicon commonly pukaara vitamin, vitamin d thi khoja in an effort to find the dietary substance that thi lacking in a beemaari, namely, rickets, the balykaal rup of osteomalacia.
additionally, jaise anya yogicon called vitamin, in the viksit world vitamin D is added to stepal bhojan, aise as milk, to avoid beemaari due to kamiyaan.
upayon of serum str pratibimbit endogenous sanshleshan isse expozar to sunlight as khub as seven isse the aahaar, or it is believed ki sanshleshan may yogadan generally to the maintenance of adequate serum ekaagratha.
The evidence indicates ki the sanshleshan of vitamin d isse surya expozar works in a feedback loop ki roktaa toxicity lakin, kuki of anischitata parichay the cancer risk from dhoop, no suzav hai jari by the santhaan of Medicine, uese, liye the raashi of surya exposure required to meet vitamin d requirements.
tadnusaar, the dietary sandarbh intakes liye vitamin d assume ki no sanshleshan occurs and ki sab of a person 's vitamin D is from unke diet, although that will rarely occur in practice.
in the jigar vitamin d is converted to calcidiol, jisase is also gyaat as calcifediol ( in ), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin d—abbreviated 25 ( oh ) d ; or jisase is the specific vitamin d metabolite ki is measured in serum to determine a vyakti 's vitamin d aukaat.
bhaag of the calcidiol is parivartit by the kidneys to calcitriol, the biologically kriyasheel rup of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the rakt, regulating the concentration of calcium or phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy vikaas or remodeling of asthi.
calcidiol is also converted to calcitriol baahar of the gurde for other uddeshy, such as the aprasar, differentiation and apoptosis of koshikaayen ; calcitriol bhi affects neuromuscular falan or sujan.
Beyond its upyog to prevent osteomalacia or rickets, the pramaan liye anya health prabhaav of vitamin d supplementation in the saamaanya janasankhyikee is asangat.
The behtareen pramaan of benefit is for asthi swasthya or a decrease in mrityu in bujurg women.

Many logon yahood involved in the invention of radio as we abhi know it.
Several sambhavit vidhi of betaar sanchaar yahood considered, sahit inductive or capacitive preran or transmission through the maidan, however the vidhi prayukt for radio aaj exclusively involves the hastantaran and resepshan of electromagnetic lehren.
baad jaldi atakalein on the subject, experimental kaary on the conection between electricity and chumbakatv began around 1820 with the work of hans Christian orsted or continued saath the work of André-Marie ampear, Joseph henry, or Michael Faraday.
ye investigations culminated in the puraa siddhanth of electromagnetism viksit by james clerk Maxwell.
is siddhanth varnit the saidhantik aadhaar of the propagation of electromagnetic lehren.
baad maxwell 's siddhanth thi published anek logon experimented saath betaar communication, kuch intentionally using Maxwell 's theory some nahin.
it is considered sambhavit ki the pehla intentional hastantaran of a signal by arthath of electromagnetic waves thi performed by David edward hughes around 1880, haalanki this thi considered to be induction at the samay.
The first systematic and unequivocal transmission of em waves thi performed by heinrich rudolph Hertz and varnit in papers published in 1887 and 1890.
Hertz famously mana ye parinaam as hone of choti practical maan.
baad hertz 's kaary anek logon yahood involved in the development of components and theory shaamil saath the hastantaran or resepshan of electromagnetic lehren.
Others, notably Guglielmo marconi, were chintit saath practical improvements or the vanijyik anuprayog of radio to wireless telegraphy.
baad on reginald A. fessenden became the pehla to bhejein an audio signal by arthath of electromagnetic lehren.
Scurvy is a beemaari resulting isse a kamiyaan of vitamin c, jisase is jaruri for the synthesis of colejan in humans.
The chemical naam liye vitamin c, escorbic acid, is niklaa isse the latin name of scurvy, scorbutus, jisase bhi provides the kriyasheel scorbutic ( `` of, characterized by or having to do saath scurvy '' ).
scurvy often presents itself initially as symptoms of malaise and lethargy, followed by gathan of spots on the skin, spanji masoodon, or bleeding isse the mucous jhilliyon.
Spots hai sabase abundant on the jaanghon and taange, or a vyakti saath the ailment looks paale, feels udhaas, or is partially immobilized.
as scurvy agrim, there can be kholen, suppurating wounds, ghaataa of teeth, pilia, fever, neuropathy or maut.
scurvy thi at one samay aam among sailors, pirates or anya aboard ships at samudr longer than perishable fal and subjiyan could be bhandaarit ( subsisting bajaay tabhi on cured or salted meats and dried dane ) or by sainiko similarly deprived of these foods liye extended avadhi.
it thi described by Hippocrates ( c. 460 BC–c. 380 bc ), or herbal cures for scurvy have maharoom gyaat in anek native samskritiyon chunki praagitihaas.
scurvy thi one of the limiting karkon of samudri safar, praayah killing vishaal sankhyaayein of the passengers or kru on long-distance voyages.
This became a significant samasya in Europe isse the shuruuaat of the aadhunik era in the aayu of discovery in the 15th sadi, continuing to khel a significant bhoomika through sansar War i in the 20th century.
jabaki today scurvy is gyaat to be caused by a nutritional deficiency, until the algaav of vitamin c and direct pramaan of iske kadi to scurvy in 1932, numerous theories or upachaar were prastaavit, praayah on choti or no praayogic data.
is asangati is attributed to the kami of vitamin c as a pruthak avadharana, an aakshamata to reliably kadi different foods ( notably upasthit in bhais citrus, watercress, and ang maance ) to scurvy.
an atirikt avadharana jaruri to samajhe scurvy was the degradation of vitamin c by expozar to air and tambe or anya parivartan metal lavan aise as those of iron, yun changing the kadi of foods to scurvy over samay.
upachaar by fresh khaanaa, visheshkar citrus fal, thi periodically implemented, as it tha maharoom since pracheenta.
however until the 1930s, treatment thi asangat, saath anek aprabhavi upachaar prayukt into the 20th century.
It was a Scottish sarjan in the royal Navy, james lind jo pehla proved it could be treated saath citrus fal in prayog he varnit in uske 1753 book, a treatise of the scurvy, haalanki his salaah thi not implemented by the royal Navy for anek dashakon.
in infants, scurvy is sometimes referred to as Barlow 's beemaari, namit baad sar thomas Barlow, a British physician jo varnit it.
however, barlow 's beemaari may bhi refer to mitral valve prolapse.
anya eponyms for scurvy shaamil moeller 's beemaari and cheadle 's disease.
scurvy karata not occur in sabase pashu kuki ve can synthesize unke own vitamin C.
however, insaano or anya ucchtar primates ( the simians - bandaron or apes - or tarsiers ), gini boar, most or all bats, or some prajati of birds or fish lack an enzyme ( l-gulonolactone oxidase ) jaruri liye aise sanshleshan and jarur obtain vitamin c through unke aahaar.
vitamin c is widespread in sanyantr utakon, saath visheshkar unchi ekaagratha occurring in citrus fal ( oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits ), tamaato, potatoes, pattagobhi, and green mirch.
aayran is a rasinic element saath the pratik Fe ( isse ) and parmaanu kramank 26.
it is a metal in the first parivartan shrenee.
it is the sabase aam tatv ( by dravyaman ) forming the planet Earth as a puure, forming much of dharti 's bahari or inner kor.
It is the chauthi sabase aam tatv in the Earth 's crust.
aayran 's bahut aam upasthiti in rocky grah jaise dharti is due to iske abundant production as a parinaam of sanlayan in high-mass sitaron, jahaan the production of nickel-56 ( jisase decays to the sabase aam samasthanik of iron ) is the pichhlaa nuclear sanlayan pratikriya that is exothermic.
is kalyankari radioskriy nikal to become the pichhlaa tatv to be produced pehle collapse of a supernova leads to the visphotak kaarykram ki scatter is precursor radionuclide of aayran abundantly into space.
Like other samooh 8 tatv, aayran exists in a chaudee dayera of oxikaran rajya, −2 to +6, although +2 and +3 hai the sabase aam.
Elemental aayran occurs in meteoroids or anya kam oxygen environments, lakin is reactive to oxigen or jal.
bhais aayran satahon appear lustrous silvery-gray, lakin oxidize in saamaanya air to de hydrated aayran oxide, commonly gyaat as rust.
naapsand anek anya dhaatuon which form passivating oxide paraton, aayran oxide occupy adhik volume than iron metal, or thus aayran oxide flake band or expose fresh satahon liye sanksharan.
Iron metal has maharoom prayukt chunki pracheen times, haalanki tambe alloys, jisase have lower melting temperatures, yahood used first in itihaas.
Pure iron is naram ( softer than aluminium ), lakin is unobtainable by smelting.
The saamagree is significantly hardened or strengthened by impurities from the smelting prakram, such as carbon.
A nishchit proportion of carbon ( between 0.002 % and 2.1 % ) produces steel, jisase may be up to 1000 times harder than pure aayran.
Crude iron metal is produced in dhamaakaa furnaces, jahaan ayask is reduced by coke to suar aayran, jisase rai a unchi carbon saamagree.
further refinement saath oxigen reduces the carbon content to the sahi proportion to make steel.
steels and low carbon iron alloys with other dhaatuon ( mishradhatu steels ) are by far the sabase aam dhaatuon in audyogic use, due to unke great dayera of desirable gun or the prachurtaa of aayran.
aayran rasinic yogicon, jisase shaamil amishrit or ferric yogicon, have many uses.
aayran oxide mixed with aluminium churna can be ignited to banaaen a thermite pratikriya, used in welding and suthra ores.
it forms shabdkosh yogicon saath the hellogence or the chalcogens.
Among its carbodhaatuk yogicon is ferrocene, the pehla sandwich compound discovered.
aayran plays an mahatvapurn bhoomika in jeevigyaan, forming devalayas with molecular oxigen in hemoglobin and myoglobin ; ye two yogicon hai aam oxigen hastantaran proteins in vertebrates.
Iron is bhi the metal prayukt at the kriyasheel sait of anek mahatvapurn redox anzimon dealing saath cellular shwasan or oxikaran or katautee in paudhe or pashu.
