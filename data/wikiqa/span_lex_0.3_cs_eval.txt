The विधिक रक्षा of set-off ( ऊपर ) थी originally introduced to prevent the अन्यायपूर्ण हालात whereby a person ( `` Party A '' ) who owed money to another ( `` Party B '' ) could be sent to debtors prison, despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A.
The law thus allows दोनो पार्टियों to टालना payment until their respective claims have been heard in court.
Upon judgment, both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing ( e.g. If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105, the two sums are set off and replaced साथ a सिंगल दायित्व of 5 इससे पार्टी b to पार्टी a ).
Set-off can also be incorporated by contractual अनुबंध so that, where a party defaults, the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished.
In certain jurisdictions ( सहित the uk ), set-off takes प्लेस automatically upon the insolvency of a company.
This means that, for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent कम्पनी, परस्पर debts हैं set-off विरूद्ध प्रत्येक अन्य, और तब either the दिवालिया 's creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid, depending on which side owed the most.
This has been criticized as an undeclared सुरक्षा ब्याज that violates the principle of pari passu.
The alternative, where a creditor has to pay all its debts, but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys कि अन्य unsecured लेनदारों मिलेंगी, मुद्राएँ the खतरे of 'knock-on ' insolvencies.
the सही to नियत बंद is विशेषकर important when reporting a bank 's exposures to regulatory authorities.
The situation where a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower ( and is therefore exposed, because there is a risk that the borrower might default thereby leading to the loss of the bank 's or its जमाकर्ताओं ' धन ) is यूँ replaced ( जहाँ the बैंको रै लिया सुरक्षा over shares or securities of the borrower ) with an exposure of the money lent minus the value of the security taken.

Conventional PCI ( पीसीआई is an initialism formed इससे परिधीय घटक इंटरकनेक्ट, part of the PCI Local Bus standard and often shortened to just PCI ) is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer.
The PCI bus supports the functions found on a प्रोसेसर बस, लकिन in a मानकीकृत format that is independent of any particular processor.
Devices connected to the bus appear to the processor to be connected directly to the प्रोसेसर बस, और हैं आबंटित पता in the प्रोसेसर 's address space.
Attached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself, पुकारा a planar यंत्र in the पीसीआई specification, or an विस्तार card that fits into a slot.
The PCI Local Bus was पहला implemented in ibm pc compatibles, where it displaced the combination of ISA plus one VESA Local Bus as the bus configuration.
It has subsequently महरूम अपनाया for other computer types.
PCI and PCI-X are being replaced by PCI Express, but, most motherboards हैं स्टिल बना साथ एक or अधिक पीसीआई slots, which are sufficient for many uses.
The पीसीआई specification कवर the शारीरिक आकार of the बस ( सहित the size and spacing of the circuit board edge electrical contacts ), electrical characteristics, bus timing, and protocols.
The specification can be purchased from the पीसीआई खास ब्याज समूह ( pci-sig ).
Typical PCI cards used in PCs include : network cards, ध्वनि ताश, modems, अतिरिक्त पोर्ट ऐसे as usb or serial, TV tuner cards and disk controllers.
PCI वीडियो ताश replaced isa और vesa ताश, जबतक growing बैंडविड्थ आवश्यकताएँ outgrew the capabilities of PCI ; the preferred interface for video cards became AGP, and then PCI Express.

Caffeine can have दोनो धनात्मक और ऋणात्मक प्रभाव on anxiety disorders.
Some people experience sleep disruption if they consume caffeine, especially during the संध्या घंटों, लकिन अन्य दिखाएँ little disturbance and the effect of caffeine on sleep is highly variable.
Evidence of a risk to pregnancy is equivocal, लकिन कुछ अधिकारियों have concluded कि दूरदर्शी सलाह is for pregnant women to limit consumption to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less.
The American Congress of Obstetricians and स्त्रीरोग ( acog ) concluded in 2010 कि caffeine consumption is safe up to 200 mg per day in pregnant women.
Caffeine has pressor and mild diuretic effects when administered to people who are not used to it, but regular users develop a tolerance to this effect, and अध्ययन have generally विफल to support the आम ख़्याल कि ordinary खपत contributes significantly to निर्जलीकरण.
With heavy use, सहिष्णुता develops rapidly to autonomic प्रभाव ऐसे as elevated दिल rate and muscle twitching, but not to the cognitive or arousal effects of caffeine.

Black Swan is a 2010 American psychological thriller and horror film directed by Darren aronofsky और अभिनीत नताली पोर्टमैन, विंसेंट Cassel, and Mila Kunis.
The plot revolves around a production of tchaikovsky 's swan झील बैले by a prestigious नई यॉर्क नगर company.
The production requires a ballerina to play the निर्दोष और नाजुक श्वेत swan, लिये जिससे the वचनबद्ध dancer Nina ( Portman ) is a perfect fit, as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities embodied by the new arrival Lily ( Kunis ).
Nina is अभिभूत by a अहसास of immense दबाव जब she finds herself competing for the part, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare.
Aronofsky conceived the premise by connecting his viewings of a उत्पादन of swan झील साथ an unrealized screenplay about understudies and the notion of being haunted by a double, similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers.
Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's `` the दोगुना `` as another प्रेरणा for the film.
The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to उसके 2008 film The Wrestler, with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art.
He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a ब्रैड अनुलग्नक to सार्वभौमिक studios, ब्लैक swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures.
Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming, and notable figures from the बैले संसार helped साथ फिल्मी उत्पादन to आकार the बैले प्रस्तुतीकरण.

The world’s first ice-calorimeter, used in the winter of 1782-83, by एंटोनी लाव्वाज़्ये और pierre-simon लाप्लास, to determine the ऊष्मा शामिल in विभिन्न रासायनिक परिवर्तन ; calculations जिससे यहूद आधारित on Joseph Black ’s prior discovery of latent heat.
These experiments mark the foundation of thermochemistry.
A calorimeter ( from Latin calor, meaning heat ) is an object used for calorimetry, or the process of measuring the ऊष्मा of रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियाएँ or शारीरिक परिवर्तन as well as heat capacity.
Differential स्कैनिंग calorimeters, समतापी microcalorimeters, titration calorimeters and accelerated rate calorimeters are among the most common types.
A सरल ऊष्मामापी बस consists of a थर्मामीटर संलग्न to a metal container full of water suspended above a combustion chamber.
To find the enthalpy change per mole of a substance A in a reaction between two substances A and B, the substances are added to a ऊष्मामापी और the आरंभिक और फाइनल temperatures ( पहले the प्रतिक्रिया प्रारंभ और बाद it has finished ) are noted.
Multiplying the temperature बदलें by the द्रव्यमान और विशिष्ट ऊष्मा capacities of the substances gives a value for the energy given off or absorbed during the reaction.
Dividing the energy change by how अनेक औज़ार of a यहूद उपस्थित देता its enthalpy change of reaction.
This method is used primarily in academic शिक्षण as it describes the सिद्धान्त of calorimetry.
It does not account for the heat loss through the container or the ऊष्मा क्षमता of the थर्मामीटर and container itself.
In addition, the object placed inside the calorimeter shows that the objects transferred their heat to the calorimeter and into the liquid, and the heat अवशोषित by the ऊष्मामापी और the द्रव is बराबर to the heat given off by the metals.

The owners of Hanjin Osaka, seen here transiting the Panama Canal in 2008, घोषित सामान्य औसत following an विस्फोट in the ship 's engine room on.
The law of general average is a legal principle of maritime law according to which all parties in a sea venture proportionally share कोई नुकसान resulting इससे a voluntary बलिदान of भाग of the जलयान or कार्गो to सहेजें the whole in an emergency.
In the exigencies of hazards faced at sea, crew members often have precious little time in which to determine precisely जिनकी कार्गो वे हैं jettisoning.
Thus, to avoid quarrelling कि could बर्बाद मूल्यवान समय, वहीँ arose the निष्पक्ष अभ्यास whereby सब the व्यापारियों जिनकी कार्गो उतरा सकुशल would be called on to contribute a portion, based upon a share or percentage, to the merchant or merchants whose goods had been tossed overboard to avert imminent peril.
While general average traces इसके origins in प्राचीन मेरीटाइम विधि, स्टिल it remains part of the admiralty law of most countries.
The पहला संहिताकरण of सामान्य average was the York Antwerp Rules of 1890.
American कंपनियाँ स्वीकृत it in 1949.
General average requires three elements which are clearly stated by mr. Justice Grier in Barnard v. Adams:
`` 1st.
A common danger : a danger in which vessel, cargo and crew all participate ; a danger imminent and जाहिर 'inevitable, ' मगर by voluntarily incurring the loss of a portion of the whole to save the remainder. ''
`` 2nd. There must be a voluntary jettison, jactus, or casting दूर, of कुछ portion of the संयुक्त चिंता लिये the purpose of बचने इस imminent peril, periculi imminentis evitandi causa, or, in other words, a transfer of the peril from the whole to a particular portion of the whole. ''

In विकासशील देशों, टीका सुझाव भी take into account the level of health care access, the cost of vaccines and issues with vaccine availability and storage.
Sample vaccinations schedules discussed by the संसार स्वास्थ्य संगठन दिखाएँ a विकसित देश using a अनुसूची जिससे extends over the पहला पाँच सालो of a चाइल्ड 's जीवन और उपयोग vaccines which cost over $ 700 including administration costs while a developing country uses a schedule providing vaccines in the first 9 months of life and costing only $ 25.
This difference is due to the lower cost of health care, the निम्नतर लागत of अनेक टीके provided to विकासशील राष्ट्र, और कि अधिक महंगी vaccines, often for less common diseases, are not utilized.
In 1900, the smallpox vaccine was the only one administered to children.
By the early 1950s, children routinely received four vaccines, for protection विरूद्ध ( डिप्थीरिया, pertussis, टेटनस, पोलियो, और smallpox ), और as अनेक as पाँच गोलियाँ by two years of age.
Since the mid-1980s, many vaccines have been added to the अनुसूची.
, the US Centers for बीमारी कंट्रोल और रोकथाम ( सीडीसी ) now recommends vaccination against at least fourteen diseases.

Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible for intestinal अवशोषण of कैल्सियम और फास्फेट.
In humans, the सबसे महत्वपूर्ण सम्बन्धित यौगिकों of vitamin D are vitamin D2 and vitamin D3.
Cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) and ergocalciferol ( vitamin D2 ) are unique as वे constitute कया we जान as विटामिन D and can be ingested from the diet and/or supplements.
The body can also synthesize vitamin D ( from cholesterol ) when sun एक्सपोज़र is पर्याप्त ( hence इसके उपनाम, the `` sunshine vitamin '' ).
Although vitamin D is commonly called a vitamin, it is not actually an essential dietary vitamin in the strict sense, as it can be synthesized in पर्याप्त amounts by सबसे स्तनधारियों उजागर to sunlight.
( Cats and dogs can नहीं synthesize विटामिन d efficiently और जरूर receive it in their diet. )
An organic chemical compound ( or सम्बन्धित नियत of यौगिकों ) is तभी scientifically पुकारा a विटामिन जब it can नहीं be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must be obtained from their diet.
However, as with other compounds commonly called vitamins, vitamin D was खोजा in an प्रयत्न to ढूँढें the dietary पदार्थ that was lacking in a disease, namely, rickets, the childhood form of osteomalacia.
Additionally, like other compounds called vitamins, in the developed संसार विटामिन d is added to स्टेपल भोजन, such as milk, to avoid disease due to deficiency.
Measures of serum levels reflect endogenous संश्लेषण इससे एक्सपोज़र to धूप as खूब as सेवन इससे the आहार, और it is believed that synthesis may contribute generally to the maintenance of adequate serum concentrations.
The प्रमाण indicates कि the संश्लेषण of विटामिन d इससे सूर्य एक्सपोज़र works in a प्रतिक्रिया लूप कि रोकता toxicity but, because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight, no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine, USA, for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D requirements.
Accordingly, the Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D assume that no synthesis occurs और कि सब of a व्यक्ति 's विटामिन d is इससे उनके आहार, हालांकि that will rarely occur in practice.
In the liver vitamin D is converted to calcidiol, which is also known as calcifediol ( इन ), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin d—abbreviated 25 ( oh ) d ; और जिससे is the विशिष्ट vitamin D metabolite that is measured in serum to determine a person 's vitamin D status.
Part of the calcidiol is converted by the kidneys to calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D. calcitriol circulates as a हार्मोन in the रक्त, regulating the विशेषज्ञता of कैल्सियम and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone.
Calcidiol is also converted to calcitriol outside of the kidneys for अन्य उद्देश्य, ऐसे as the अप्रसार, differentiation और apoptosis of cells ; calcitriol also affects neuromuscular function and inflammation.
Beyond its use to prevent osteomalacia or rickets, the evidence for other health प्रभाव of विटामिन d supplementation in the सामान्य population is inconsistent.
The best evidence of benefit is for bone स्वास्थ्य और a घटी in mortality in elderly women.
मानक रूप of the periodic table.
the रंगों represent अलग categories of elements explained below.
The periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic numbers, इलेक्ट्रॉन configurations, और पुनरावर्ती रासायनिक properties.
तत्व हैं प्रस्तुत in अनुक्रम of increasing atomic number ( number of protons ).
The standard form of table comprises an 18 × 7 grid or main देह of तत्व, positioned ऊपर a छोटी double row of elements.
The table can also be deconstructed into four आयताकार ब्लॉक : the s-block to the left, the p-block to the right, the d-block in the middle, and the f-block below that.
The rows of the table are called periods ; the columns of the s-, d-, and p-blocks हैं पुकारा समूह, साथ कुछ of ये having names such as the halogens or the noble gases.
Since, by definition, a periodic table incorporates recurring trends, any such table can be used to derive relationships between the गुण of the तत्व और भविष्यवाणी the गुण of नई, yet to be खोजा or synthesized, तत्व.
As a result, a periodic table—whether in the standard form or some other variant—provides a उपयोगी फ्रेमवर्क लिये analyzing रासायनिक बर्ताव, और ऐसे टेबल हैं widely used in chemistry and other sciences.
Although precursors exist, Dmitri mendeleev is generally credited साथ the प्रकाशन, in 1869, of the first widely recognized periodic table.
He developed his table to illustrate आवधिक रुझान in the गुण of the then-known elements.
Mendeleev also predicted कुछ गुण of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table.
Most of his पूर्वानुमान यहूद proved सही जब the elements in question were subsequently discovered.
Mendeleev 's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new तत्व और the विकास of नई सैद्धांतिक मॉडल to बताइये रासायनिक बर्ताव.
All elements from परमाणु संख्याएँ 1 ( हाइड्रोजन ) to 118 ( ununoctium ) have been discovered or synthesized.
The elements from 1 to 98 ( californium ) have been found to exist naturally, although some are found only in trace amounts और यहूद initially खोजा by synthesis in laboratories.
The elements after 98 have तभी महरूम synthesized in laboratories.
Production of elements beyond ununoctium is being pursued, with the question of how the periodic table may need to be परिवर्धित to accommodate कोई ऐसे परिवर्धन होने a पदार्थ of ongoing debate.
Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring तत्व have भी महरूम उत्पादित in laboratories.

the अस्तित्व of अनेक तत्व in उनके लवण was suspected from 1702, and this was proven in 1807 when potassium and sodium were individually isolated from different salts by electrolysis.
Potassium in nature occurs तभी in ionic salts.
As such, it is found dissolved in seawater ( जिससे is 0.04 % पोटैशियम by weight ), and is part of many minerals.
Most industrial chemical applications of potassium employ the relatively high solubility in जल of पोटैशियम यौगिकों, ऐसे as potassium soaps.
Potassium metal has only a few special applications, होने replaced in सबसे रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियाएँ साथ सोडियम metal.
Potassium ions हैं जरुरी for the function of all living cells.

Potassium accumulates in संयंत्र कोशिकाएं, और यूँ fresh fruits and vegetables are a good dietary source of it.
Conversely, most पौधे मगर विशेषज्ञ halophytes are intolerant of salt, and sodium is present in them only in low concentration.
This resulted in पोटैशियम पहला होने पृथक from potash, the ashes of plants, giving the element its name.
For the same reason, भारी क्रॉप उत्पादन rapidly depletes soils of पोटैशियम, और agricultural fertilizers consume 95 % of global potassium chemical production.

The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily और decoded to reproduce the original digital data.
modems can be प्रयुक्त over कोई अर्थात् of transmitting analog signals, from light emitting diodes to radio.
The most familiar example is a voice band modem कि turns the डिजिटल आंकड़ा of a निजी कंप्यूटर into modulated electrical signals in the voice frequency range of a telephone channel.
These signals can be transmitted over टेलीफोन लाइनों और demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data.
Modems are generally classified by the amount of आंकड़ा वे can भेजें in a दिए ईकाई of समय, प्रायः expressed in bits per second ( bit/s, or bps ), or bytes per second ( B/s ).
Modems can alternatively be वर्गीकृत by उनके प्रतीक rate, measured in baud.
The baud ईकाई denotes प्रतीकों प्रति दूसरी, or the number of times per second the modem sends a new signal.
For example, the ITU V.21 standard used audio frequency shift keying with two संभावित बारंबारता सम्बन्धित to दो distinct symbols ( or one bit per symbol ), to carry 300 bits per second using 300 baud.
By contrast, the original itu v.22 मानक, जिससे थी समर्थ to संचारण और प्राप्त चार पृथक प्रतीकों ( दो बिट्स per symbol ), handled 1,200 bit/s by sending 600 symbols per second ( 600 baud ) using phase shift keying.

The most famous version of the Declaration, a signed copy that is popularly regarded as the घोषणा of स्वतंत्रता, is प्रदर्शित at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.
Although the wording of the Declaration was स्वीकृत on जुलाई 4, the तिथि of इसके हस्ताक्षर was August 2.
The original July 4 United States Declaration of Independence manuscript थी खोया जबकि सब अन्य नक़ल have been derived from this original document.
The sources and interpretation of the घोषणा have महरूम the विषय of much scholarly inquiry.
The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances विरूद्ध किंग जार्ज iii, और by asserting certain natural and legal rights, including a right of revolution.
Having served its असली purpose in announcing स्वतंत्रता, the text of the Declaration was initially ignored after the American Revolution.
Since then, it रै आइये to be considered a major statement on human rights, particularly its second sentence:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by उनके निर्माता साथ निश्चित unalienable अधिकारों, कि among ये हैं Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
This has been called `` one of the best-known वाक्य in the अंग्रेज़ी भाषा '', containing `` the सबसे potent and consequential words in American history. ''
The passage came to represent a moral मानक to जिससे the United States should strive.
This view was notably प्रचारित by अब्राहम lincoln, जो माना the घोषणा to be the foundation of his political philosophy, and argued that the Declaration is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted.
It has inspired work for the rights of अधिकारहीन लोगों throughout the world.
The Economy of Greenland can be characterized as small, मिश्रित और vulnerable.
The उपस्थित अर्थव्यवस्था consists of a बिग पब्लिक सेक्टर और व्यापक विदेशी trade, which has resulted in an economy with periods of strong growth, considerable inflation, unemployment problems and extreme dependence on capital inflow from Denmark and use of outside, mainly Danish, skilled labor.
GDP per capita is similar to the average European economies but the economy is critically dependent upon substantial support from the Danish government, which supplies about half the revenues of the home नियम सरकारी जो in फेरे employ परिचय 8,000 greenlanders आउट of a मजदूर फ़ोर्स of 40,156 ( jan. 2012 ).
Unemployment nonetheless remains high, with the rest of the अर्थव्यवस्था निर्भर upon माँग लिये exports of shrimp and fish.
हाइड्रोजन is a रासायनिक तत्व with symbol H and atomic number 1.
With an atomic weight of ( for hydrogen-1 ), हाइड्रोजन is the lightest तत्व और इसके monatomic रूप ( h1 ) is the most abundant chemical substance, constituting roughly 75 % of the Universe 's baryonic mass.
Non- remnant stars हैं मुख्यतः रचित of हाइड्रोजन in its plasma state.
at मानक तापमान और दबाव, हाइड्रोजन is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2.
Most of the hydrogen on Earth is in molecules such as water and organic यौगिकों क्युकी हाइड्रोजन readily फ़ॉर्म covalent यौगिकों साथ सबसे non-metallic elements.
Hydrogen plays a विशेषकर महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका in acid-base रसायन साथ अनेक reactions exchanging protons between soluble molecules.
In ionic compounds, it can लो a ऋणात्मक चार्ज ( an anion ज्ञात as a hydride and written as H− ), or as a positively charged species H+.
the latter cation is लिखा as हालांकि रचित of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds always occur as more complex species.
The most common isotope of हाइड्रोजन is protium ( नाम rarely प्रयुक्त, प्रतीक 1h ) with a single proton and no neutrons.
as the सरलतम अणु ज्ञात, the hydrogen atom has been of theoretical use.
For example, as the only neutral atom with an analytic solution to the Schrödinger equation, the study of the energetics and bonding of the हाइड्रोजन अणु निभाई a कुंजी भूमिका in the development of quantum mechanics.
Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th सदी, via the mixing of metals with acids.
In 1766–81, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, a property which later gave it its name : in Greek, हाइड्रोजन अर्थात् `` water-former ''.
Industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of प्राकृतिक गैस, और कम प्रायः इससे more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like the electrolysis of water.
Most hydrogen is employed near its production साईट, साथ the दो largest उपयोग होने चट्टान ईंधन प्रसंस्करण ( e.g., hydrocracking ) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market.
Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle अनेक धातुओं, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.
Unstoppable is a 2010 American action thriller film निर्देशित by टोनी स्कॉट, लिखा by चिह्नित bomback, और अभिनीत डेंज़ल Washington and Chris Pine.
The film, loosely based on the real-life csx 8888 घटना, tells the स्टोरी of a runaway freight train, and the two men ( Washington and Pine ) who manage to stop it.
It was Scott 's final feature film पहले उसके मौत in 2012.
The film was released in the United States and Canada on नवम्बर 12, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on November 24, 2010.
It received mostly favorable reviews from film critics ; it garnered a `` certified भैस '' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based upon aggregated reviews and a rating of `` Generally favorable reviews '' at Metacritic.

In photography, bracketing is the सामान्य तकनीक of लेने अनेक गोलियाँ of the same subject using different camera settings.
Bracketing is useful and often recommended in situations that make it difficult to obtain a satisfactory image with a single shot, विशेषकर जब a छोटी विभिन्नता in एक्सपोज़र पैरामीटर्स रै a comparatively विशाल प्रभाव on the resulting image.
Autobracketing is automatic bracketing by using a setting on the camera to take several bracketed गोलियाँ ( in कंट्रास्ट to the photographer altering the settings by hand between each shot ).
Given the time it takes to accomplish multiple shots, it is typically, but not always, used for static विषय.
Insulated glazing ( IG ), more commonly known as double glazing ( or double-pane, and increasingly triple glazing/pane ) हैं दोगुना or ट्रिपल कांच खिड़की panes अलग by an एयर or other gas filled space to reduce heat transfer across a part of the building envelope.
Insulated Glass Units are manufactured with glass in range of thickness from 3 mm to 10 mm or अधिक in खास अनुप्रयोग.
laminated or tempered कांच may also be used as part of the construction.
Most units are manufactured with the same thickness of glass used on both panes but special applications such as acoustic attenuation or security may आवश्यकता चौड़ी सीमाएँ of thicknesses to be incorporated in the same unit.

Selenium is a रासायनिक तत्व साथ प्रतीक Se and atomic number 34.
It is a nonmetal with properties that are intermediate between those of its आवधिक तालिका column-adjacent chalcogen elements sulfur and tellurium.
It rarely occurs in its elemental राज्य in प्रकृति, or as pure ore compounds.
Selenium ( Greek σελήνη selene meaning `` Moon '' ) was discovered in 1817 by jöns याक़ूब berzelius, जो विख्यात the समानता of the नई तत्व to the previously-known tellurium ( named for the Earth ).
Selenium is found impurely in metal sulfide ores, जहाँ it partially replaces the sulfur.
Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the शोधन of ये ores, सबसे प्रायः during copper production.
Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate यौगिकों हैं ज्ञात, but are rare.
The chief वाणिज्यिक उपयोग लिये सेलेनियम आज हैं in glassmaking and in pigments.
Selenium is a semiconductor और is प्रयुक्त in photocells.
Uses in electronics, once important, have महरूम ज़्यादातर supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices.
Selenium continues to be प्रयुक्त in a few प्रकार of dc शक्ति surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.
Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are जरुरी लिये सेल्यूलर फलन in अनेक जीवों, including all animals.
Selenium is a component of the antioxidant एंजाइमों glutathione peroxidase और thioredoxin reductase ( which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants ).
It is also मिला in तीन deiodinase एंजाइमों, which convert one thyroid hormone to another.
Selenium requirements in plants differ by प्रजाति, साथ कुछ पौधे requiring अपेक्षाकृत large amounts, and others apparently requiring none.

A close up picture of a गैंडा skin.
Skin is the soft outer covering of vertebrates.
अन्य एनिमल छतरियाँ ऐसे as the सन्धिपाद बहि have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition.
The adjective cutaneous अर्थात् `` of the स्किन '' ( इससे Latin cutis, skin ).
In स्तनधारियों, the स्किन is the largest अंग of the integumentary प्रणाली made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs.
Skin of a अलग nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds.
All स्तनधारियों have कुछ बाल on उनके skin, even marine mammals which appear to be hairless.
The skin interfaces साथ the पर्यावरण and is the first line of defense from external factors.
For example, the skin plays a key भूमिका in protecting the देह against pathogens and excessive water loss.
Its other functions are insulation, temperature विनियमन, सनसनी, और the उत्पादन of vitamin D folates.
severely क्षतिग्रस्त स्किन may heal by forming scar tissue.
This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented.
the मोटाई of स्किन भी varies from location to location on an organism.
In humans for उदाहरण, the स्किन स्तिथ अंतर्गत the आँखें और around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as `` crows feet '' and wrinkles.
The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and the thickest स्किन in the देह.
फर is घना hair.
Primarily, fur augments the इन्सुलेशन the स्किन provides लकिन can also serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage.
On some animals, the skin is very hard and मोटा, और can be processed to बनाएँ leather.
Reptiles and fish have hard सुरक्षात्मक तराजू on उनके स्किन लिये protection, and birds have hard feathers, all made of tough β- keratins.

Using similar measurements he showed that comets were also not वायुमंडलीय phenomena, as previously विचार, and must pass through the supposedly `` immutable '' celestial spheres.
As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he देखी as the geometrical लाभ of the copernican प्रणाली साथ the philosophical लाभ of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe, the Tychonic system.

Hertz famously माना ये परिणाम as being of little practical value.
After Hertz 's work many people were involved in the development of components और सिद्धान्त शामिल साथ the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves.
Others, notably Guglielmo Marconi, were concerned साथ व्यावहारिक सुधार और the वाणिज्यिक अनुप्रयोग of radio to wireless telegraphy.

Scurvy often presents itself initially as लक्षण of malaise और lethargy, followed by formation of spots on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding from the mucous membranes.
Spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a व्यक्ति साथ the ailment looks पाले, feels उदास, and is partially immobilized.
As scurvy advances, there can be open, suppurating wounds, loss of दांत, पीलिया, ज्वर, न्यूरोपैथी और मौत.
Scurvy was at one time common among sailors, pirates and others aboard ships at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored ( subsisting instead only on cured and salted meats and dried grains ) and by सैनिको similarly वंचित of ये भोजन लिये विस्तारित अवधि.
It was described by Hippocrates ( c. 460 BC–c. 380 BC ), and herbal cures for scurvy have महरूम ज्ञात in अनेक देशी संस्कृतियों चूंकि prehistory.
Scurvy थी एक of the limiting कारकों of समुद्री सफर, often killing large numbers of the passengers and crew on long-distance voyages.
This became a significant issue in Europe from the beginning of the modern era in the Age of Discovery in the 15th century, continuing to play a significant role through World War I in the 20th सदी.
While आज स्कर्वी is ज्ञात to be caused by a nutritional कमियां, until the isolation of vitamin C and direct evidence of its link to scurvy in 1932, numerous theories and treatments were proposed, often on little or no experimental data.
This inconsistency is attributed to the lack of vitamin C as a distinct concept, an inability to reliably link अलग भोजन ( notably उपस्थित in भैस citrus, watercress, and organ meat ) to scurvy.
An additional concept required to understand scurvy was the degradation of vitamin C by एक्सपोज़र to एयर और तांबे और अन्य परिवर्तन मेटल लवण ऐसे as those of आयरन, यूँ बदलना the कड़ी of foods to scurvy over time.
Treatment by fresh food, particularly citrus fruit, was periodically implemented, as it था महरूम चूंकि antiquity.
However जबतक the 1930s, उपचार थी inconsistent, with many ineffective treatments used into the 20th century.
It was a Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind who first proved it could be treated with citrus फल in प्रयोग he वर्णित in उसके 1753 किताब, a treatise of the स्कर्वी, हालांकि उसके advice was not implemented by the Royal Navy for several decades.
In infants, स्कर्वी is sometimes referred to as barlow 's disease, named after Sir Thomas Barlow, a British physician who described it.
However, Barlow 's disease may also refer to mitral वाल्व prolapse.
Other eponyms for स्कर्वी शामिल moeller 's disease and Cheadle 's disease.
Scurvy does not occur in most animals because they can synthesize उनके अपना विटामिन c.
However, humans and other higher primates ( the simians - बंदरों और apes - और tarsiers ), गिनी सूअर, सबसे or सब bats, और some species of birds and fish lack an enzyme ( L-gulonolactone oxidase ) necessary for such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet.
Vitamin C is widespread in संयंत्र ऊतकों, साथ विशेषकर ऊँची एकाग्रता occurring in citrus fruits ( oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits ), tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages, and green peppers.
आयरन is a रासायनिक तत्व with the symbol Fe ( from ) and atomic number 26.
It is a metal in the पहला परिवर्तन series.
It is the सबसे आम तत्व ( by द्रव्यमान ) forming the ग्रह धरती as a whole, forming much of Earth 's outer and inner core.
It is the चौथी सबसे आम तत्व in the Earth 's crust.
Iron 's बहुत आम उपस्थिति in रॉकी ग्रह जैसे धरती is due to इसके abundant उत्पादन as a result of fusion in high-mass stars, where the production of nickel-56 ( which decays to the most common isotope of iron ) is the last nuclear fusion reaction that is exothermic.
This causes radioactive nickel to become the last element to be उत्पादित पहले पतन of a सुपरनोवा लीड to the विस्फोटक कार्यक्रम that scatter this precursor radionuclide of iron abundantly into space.
Like other समूह 8 तत्व, आयरन exists in a चौड़ी दायरा of ऑक्सीकरण states, −2 to +6, although +2 and +3 are the most common.
Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is प्रतिक्रिया to ऑक्सीजन और जल.
Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, लकिन oxidize in सामान्य एयर to दे hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust.
Unlike अनेक अन्य धातुओं जिससे रूप passivating ऑक्साइड परतों, iron oxides occupy more volume than iron metal, and thus iron oxides flake off and expose fresh surfaces for corrosion.
Iron metal has been used since प्राचीन टाइम्स, हालांकि तांबे alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used first in history.
Pure iron is नरम ( softer than एल्युमिनियम ), लकिन is unobtainable by smelting.
The सामग्री is significantly hardened और strengthened by impurities from the smelting process, such as carbon.
A certain proportion of carbon ( between 0.002 % और 2.1 % ) produces steel, which may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron.
crude आयरन मेटल is उत्पादित in धमाका furnaces, जहाँ अयस्क is घटाया by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content.
Further refinement with oxygen reduces the कार्बन सामग्री to the सही proportion to make steel.
Steels and low carbon iron alloys with other metals ( alloy steels ) are by far the most common metals in industrial use, due to उनके ग्रेट दायरा of वांछनीय properties and the abundance of iron.
Iron chemical compounds, which include ferrous और ferric यौगिकों, have many uses.
Iron oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be ignited to बनाएँ a थर्माइट प्रतिक्रिया, प्रयुक्त in वेल्डिंग और सुथरा ores.
It forms binary compounds with the halogens and the chalcogens.
Among its organometallic यौगिकों is ferrocene, the first sandwich compound discovered.
Iron plays an important role in जीवविज्ञान, forming देवालय साथ आणविक oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin ; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates.
Iron is also the metal प्रयुक्त at the क्रियाशील साईट of अनेक महत्वपूर्ण रेडॉक्स एंजाइमों dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.

These printed materials were legal documents, magazines, newspapers and many other types of paper प्रयुक्त throughout the colonies.
Like previous taxes, the stamp tax had to be सशुल्क in मान्य अंग्रेजों currency, not in colonial paper money.
The purpose of the कर थी to सहायता अदा लिये सैनिकों stationed in उत्तर अमेरिका after the British victory in the Seven Years ' War.
The British government felt that the colonies were the primary beneficiaries of इस सैन्य उपस्थिति, और चाहिए अदा at तनिक a portion of the expense.
The Stamp Act met ग्रेट प्रतिरोध in the colonies.
The colonies भेजा no प्रतिनिधि to पार्लियामेंट, and therefore had no influence over what taxes were raised, how they were levied, or how they would be spent.
Many colonists considered it a violation of उनके अधिकारों as अंग्रेजो to be taxed बगैर उनके सहमति —consent that only the colonial legislatures could grant.
Colonial सभाओं भेजा याचिकाएं और विरोध.
The Stamp Act Congress held in New York City, reflecting the first significant joint colonial response to कोई अंग्रेजों माप, भी petitioned पार्लियामेंट और the किंग.
Local protest groups, led by colonial merchants and landowners, established connections through correspondence that created a loose गठबन्धन कि विस्तारित इससे नई इंग्लैण्ड to Georgia.
Protests and demonstrations initiated by the Sons of स्वतंत्रता प्रायः turned हिंसक और destructive as the masses became involved.
Very soon all stamp tax distributors were intimidated into resigning their commissions, and the कर थी never effectively एकत्रित.
Opposition to the Stamp Act was नहीं सीमित to the colonies.
British merchants and निर्माताओं, जिनकी निर्यात to the colonies were threatened by colonial economic problems exacerbated by the tax, also pressured Parliament.
The Act थी repealed on कूच 18, 1766 as a पदार्थ of expedience, but Parliament affirmed its power to legislate for the colonies “in all cases whatsoever” by also passing the Declaratory Act.

The attack on Pearl Harbor ( called Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters ( Operation Z in planning ) and the Battle of Pearl Harbor ) was a surprise सैन्य स्ट्राइक conducted by the इम्पीरियल जापानी नेवी विरूद्ध the संयुक्त राज्य नवल आधार at पर्ल हार्बर, हवाई, on the morning of December 7, 1941 ( December 8 in Japan ).
From the standpoint of the defenders, the attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time.
The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the संयुक्त किंगडम, the नीदरलैंड्स, और the संयुक्त राज्य.
The base was attacked by 353 Japanese fighters, बमवर्षक और torpedo planes in दो लहरें, शुभारम्भ इससे छह वायुयान carriers.
All eight U.S. Navy battleships were क्षतिग्रस्त, साथ चार being sunk.
Two of these यहूद बाद उठाया, और साथ the बाकी चार repaired, six battleships returned to service later in the war.
The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, तीन destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer.

When the compass is in use, the rose is aligned साथ the रियल दिशानिर्देश in the फ़्रेम of सन्दर्भ, so, लिये उदाहरण, the `` N '' mark on the rose really points to the north.
अक्सर, in जोड to the रोज़ or sometimes instead of it, angle markings in degrees are shown on the compass.
North corresponds to zero degrees, and the कोण बढ़ाएँ clockwise, so ईस्ट is 90 degrees, south is 180, and west is 270.
These numbers allow the कम्पास to दिखाएँ azimuths or bearings, which are commonly stated in this notation.
The magnetic compass was first invented as a यंत्र लिये भविष्यवाणी as जल्दी as the Chinese Han Dynasty ( Since about 206 BC ).
The compass was used in Song Dynasty China by the military for navigational orienteering by 1040-1044, and was used for मेरीटाइम नेविगेशन by 1111 to 1117.
The use of a compass is recorded in Western Europe between 1187 and 1202, और in फारस in 1232.

Maintaining this standard of thermal comfort for occupants of buildings or other enclosures is one of the महत्वपूर्ण लक्ष्य of HVAC ( heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ) design engineers.
The Predicted Mean Vote ( pmv ) मॉडल स्टैंड among the सबसे पहचाना थर्मल सुकून models.
It was विकसित using सिद्धान्त of ऊष्मा संतुलन और प्रायोगिक data collected in a controlled climate chamber under steady state conditions.
Because the PMV model was derived from data collected in a controlled climate, it is not suitable for अनुप्रयोग in naturally हवादार स्पेसेस जिससे प्रायः have ऊँची स्तर of air movement.
This shortcoming motivated the development of a family of empirical statistical मॉडल of थर्मल सुकून in naturally हवादार स्पेसेस ज्ञात as अनुकूली मॉडल.
Adaptive models of thermal comfort consider occupants as dynamically interacting with their environment, and controlling their thermal सुकून by अर्थात् of कपडे or window-opening and closing.
This is in contrast to थर्मल सुकून in sealed इमारतें, in जिससे occupants अनुभव the environment passively.
Thermal comfort is affected by heat conduction, convection, विकिरण, और evaporative ऊष्मा loss.
Thermal comfort is maintained when the heat generated by human चयापचय is अनुमत to dissipate, यूँ maintaining थर्मल equilibrium with the surroundings.
It has been long recognized that the sensation of feeling hot or ठंडा is नहीं बस निर्भर on एयर तापमान अलोन.
