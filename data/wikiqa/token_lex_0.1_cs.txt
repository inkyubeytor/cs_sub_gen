In physics, circular motion is a movement of an ऑब्जेक्ट along the circumference of a वृत्त or rotation along a circular path.
It can be uniform, with constant कोणीय rate of rotation ( and निरंतर speed ), or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation.
The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts.
The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body.
Examples of circular motion include : an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth at constant height, a स्टोन which is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles, a car turning through a curve in a रेस track, an इलेक्ट्रॉन moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, and a gear turning inside a यांत्रिकी.
Since the object 's velocity vector is constantly बदलना direction, the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a अभिकेन्द्रीय फ़ोर्स in the direction of the center of rotation.
Without this acceleration, the ऑब्जेक्ट would move in a straight line, according to Newton 's कानून of motion.

Variable Universal Life Insurance ( often shortened to VUL ) is a प्रकार of जीवन insurance that builds a cash मान.
In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the उपलब्धियाँ separate खाते to use is entirely up to the contract owner.
The 'variable ' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets.
The 'universal ' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments.
The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance.
This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed प्रीमियम payments that typically can नहीं be missed without lapsing the policy ( although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium ).
Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance, because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy.
With most if not all VULs, unlike whole life, वहीँ is no endowment age ( the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount, which for पूरे life is typically 100 ).
This is yet another key advantage of VUL over पूरे Life.
With a typical whole life policy, the मौत benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment आयु, the फेस amount is all that is paid out.
Thus with either death or endowment, the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years.
However, some participating whole life नीतियों प्रस्ताव riders which बताएँ that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase `` paid up additions '' to the नीति which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time.
If investments made in the separate accounts out-perform the general account of the insurance कम्पनी, a higher rate-of-return can occur than the fixed rates-of-return typical लिये whole life.
The संयोजन over the years of no endowment age, continually increasing मौत benefit, and if a high rate-of-return is earned in the separate accounts of a VUL policy, this could result in उच्चतर मान to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as प्रीमियम.

Deepwater drilling is the process of oil and gas exploration and production in depths of more than 500 फीट.
By इस definition, there are approximately 600 deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
It has been economically infeasible for many years, but with rising oil prices, more companies are निवेश in this area.
Major companies working in this sector include Diamond offshore, TransOcean, और बेकर Hughes.
There are basically two kinds of mobile deepwater drilling rigs : semi-submersible drilling rigs and drillships.
Drilling can also be performed from a fixed-position installation such as a floating spar ( platform ) or tension-leg platform.
हाल industry analysis has estimated कि the total expenditure in the global deepwater infrastructure मार्केट will reach $ 145bn in 2011.
“Not all oil is accessible on land or in shallow water.
You can find some आयल deposits buried deep under the ocean floor.”... Using sonic equipment, oil companies determine the drilling sites most likely to उपज आयल.
Then वे उपयोग a mobile offshore drilling unit ( MODU ) to dig the initial well.
Some units are converted into production rigs, meaning they switch from drilling for oil to capturing आयल once it 's found.
Most of the time, the oil company will बदलें the MODU with a more permanent oil production rig to capture oil.”... The MODU 's job is to drill down into the ocean 's मंजिल to find आयल deposits.
The part of the drill that extends below the deck and through the water is called the riser.
The riser allows for drilling fluids to move between the मंजिल and the rig.
Engineers lower a drill string -- a series of pipes designed to drill down to the oil deposit -- through the riser.”
“The expansion of deepwater drilling is happening despite accidents in offshore fields... ”
In 2010 a विशाल explosion occurred killing 11 workers and spilling millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico while a BP oil rig was drilling in deep waters.
“... despite the risks, the deepwater drilling trend is spreading in the भूमध्यसागरीय and off the coast of East Africa after a string of huge discoveries of natural gas.”
“The reason for the resumption of such drilling, analyst say, is continuing high demand for उर्जा worldwide.”
America needs the oil so it is almost necessary to face the high risks that आइये with deepwater drilling in order for Americans to continue to carry on their everyday lives.
“The Energy Department recently projected that gulf आयल production would expand इससे its 2011 level of 1.3 million barrels a day, still nearly a quarter of total domestic production, to 2 million barrels a day by 2020.”
Deepwater drilling affects the environment in both negative and positive ways.
Although Deepwater drilling rarely causes oil spills it is still a hazardous possible outcome.
Oil spills परिणाम in oil sinking to the bottom of the ocean smothering plant life leaving मछली without food and shelter to survive.
On the other hand deepwater drilling effects the environment in a positive ways too.
In time once the deepwater आयल well is not in use anymore plants will grow on and around the well making a cave or cavern like shelter ideal for animals to thrive in.
Deepwater drilling also lets us see the depths of the ocean floor that are hardly ever seen.
”Cameras on rovers at the bottom of the wells रिकार्ड footage and take photos of rare fish कि are in there natural habitat, giving scientist a look at animals they rarely seen” ( Chevron निगम ). ''

A fern is any one or more of a group of about 12,000 species of plants belonging to the botanical group known as Pteridophyta.
नापसंद mosses, they have xylem and फ्लोएम ( making them vascular plants ).
They have stems, leaves, and roots like other vascular plants.
Ferns reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor पुष्प.
By far the largest group of ferns is the leptosporangiate ferns, but ferns as defined here ( भी called monilophytes ) include horsetails, whisk ferns, marattioid ferns, and ophioglossoid ferns.
The term pteridophyte also refers to ferns and a few other seedless vascular plants ( see classification section below ).
Ferns first appear in the fossil record 360 million years ago in the carboniferous but many of the current families और species did not appear until roughly 145 million years ago in the early cretaceous ( after flowering plants came to dominate many environments ).
Ferns are not of major economic importance, but some are grown or gathered for food, as ornamental plants, for remediating contaminated soils, and have been the subject of research for their ability to remove कुछ chemical pollutants from the air.
Some are significant weeds.
They also play a role in mythology, medicine, और art.
Flat roofs in Israel
Flat roof in Los Angeles
A flat roof is a प्रकार of covering for a building.
In contrast to the more sloped रूप of roof, a flat छत is horizontal or nearly horizontal.
The slope of a roof is properly known as its pitch : Roofs which हैं nearly flat are known as low-pitch roofs ( as the angle of slope increases, so the pitch is said to बढ़ाएँ ).
Any sheet of material used to कवर a flat or low-pitched छत is प्रायः known as a membrane and the प्राथमिक purpose of these झिल्लियों is to waterproof the roof क्षेत्रफल.
Materials that cover flat roofs typically allow the water to run बंद from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter system.
Water from some flat roofs such as on garden sheds sometimes flows freely बंद the edge of a roof, though gutter systems are of advantage in keeping दोनो walls and foundations dry.
Gutters on smaller roofs प्रायः lead water directly onto the मैदान, or better, into a specially made soakaway.
Gutters on larger roofs प्रायः सीसे water into the rainwater drainage system of any built up area.
Occasionally flat roofs though are designed to collect water in a पूल, usually लिये aesthetic purposes, or for rainwater buffering.
Flat roofs exist all over the संसार और each क्षेत्रफल has its own tradition or preference लिये materials used.
In warmer climes जहाँ rainfall is less and freezing is unlikely to occur, many flat roofs are simply built of masonry or concrete and this is good at keeping out the heat of the sun और cheap and easy to build where timber is नहीं readily available.
In areas जहाँ the roof could become saturated by rain and leak, or where water soaked into the brickwork could freeze to बर्फ and thus lead to 'blowing ' ( breaking up of the mortar/brickwork/concrete by the expansion of ice as it forms ) these roofs are not उपयुक्त.
Traditionally most flat roofs in the western world make use of tar or more usually tar paper applied over छत decking to keep a building watertight.
The tar or tarpaper is in turn covered in gravel to keep the sun 's heat, UV किरणें और weather off it and helps protect it from cracking or blistering and degradation.
छत decking is usually of plywood, chipboard or OSB boards ( OSB = Oriented Strand Board, also known as स्टर्लिंग board ) of around 18mm thickness.
The tar coating is applied in one or more coats as a hot liquid, heated in a तारकोल kettle, or as sheets of tar impregnated 'paper ' glued bas and sealed together at joints by hot tar - once it has cooled, the gravel is spread evenly over it.
A main कारण for failure of these traditional roofs is ignorance or lack of maintenance where people or events cause the gravel to be moved or removed from the tar or tarpaper waterproofing, thus exposing it to weather and सूर्य whereupon cracking and blistering occurs over time and eventually water gets in.
Tarpaper is usually a 'paper ' or fibre material soaked or impregnated in तारकोल.
As बजरी can not protect tarpaper surfaces where वे rise vertically from the roof such as on parapet walls or upstands, tarpaper variants are produced with fine gravel लागू to the hot tar during the process of manufacture such that a permanent layer of बजरी is stuck to it in अनुक्रम to give it ongoing सुरक्षा.
Tarpapers vary in quality as does the workmanship and training of those applying it to produce more or less successful results.
In some micro climates or shaded areas these rather 'basic ' tarpaper roofs can last well in संबंध to the cost of materials purchase and cost of laying them, however the cost of modern membranes such as EPDM has come down over recent सालो to make them more and more affordable.
There are now more firms supplying modern alternatives and there is generally a growing awareness of उनके performance and availability.
If a leak does occur on a flat roof तब damage often goes unnoticed for long periods of time दौरान which water penetrates and soaks the decking and any insulation and/or structure beneath it.
This can सीसे to expensive क्षति from the rot which often develops and if left can weaken the roof structure.
There are also various health risks to लोगों and animals श्वास the mould spores : the severity of this health risk remains a debated point.
One problem with maintaining flat roofs is that if water does penetrate the barrier covering ( be it traditional or a modern membrane ) it can travel a long way before causing visible damage or leaking into a building जहाँ it can be देखी.
Thus it is not easy to see जहाँ it is leaking in order to मरम्मत it.
Once underlying roof decking is soaked it often sags causing a further संग्रहण or puddling of जल in that area and the प्रॉब्लम worsens.

Joanne `` Jo '' Rowling ( ), ( born 31 जुलाई 1965 ), pen नाम J. K. Rowling, is a British novelist, best known as the author of the Harry Potter fantasy series.
The Potter books have gained worldwide attention, won multiple awards, और sold more than 400 million copies.
They have become the best-selling book series in history, and been the basis for a series of films which has become the highest-grossing film series in history.
Rowling had overall approval on the scripts as well as maintaining creative control by serving as a producer on the final instalment.
Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty अंतरराष्ट्रीय when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990.
The seven-year period that followed entailed the death of her mother, divorce from her first husband and poverty until Rowling समाप्त the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone ( 1997 ).
रोलिंग subsequently published 6 sequels—the last, हैरी Potter and the Deathly hallows ( 2007 ) —as खूब as 3 supplements to the series.
In 2012, रोलिंग parted with her agency and resumed writing in the form of a tragicomedy novel aimed at adult readership, entitled The Casual Vacancy.
Rowling has said she is currently working on two books—one aimed for adults, the other for children younger than the Harry Potter audience, and she expects the latter to be published first.
रोलिंग has led a `` rags to riches `` life story, in which she progressed इससे living on state benefits to multi-millionaire status within five years.
She is the United Kingdom 's best-selling author since records began, with sales in excess of £238m.

The eye, eyewall, and surrounding rainbands, characteristics of tropical cyclones, are clearly visible in this view इससे space.
A तीव्र cyclone is a storm system characterized by a low-pressure center surrounded by a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain.
Tropical cyclones strengthen when जल evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated एयर उदय, resulting in condensation of water वाष्प contained in the moist air.
They are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as nor'easters, European windstorms, and polar lows.
The characteristic कि separates tropical cyclones from other cyclonic systems is that at any height in the atmosphere, the center of a tropical cyclone will be warmer than its surroundings ; a phenomenon called `` warm core `` storm systems.
The term `` tropical '' refers both to the geographical origin of these systems, which usually form in tropical regions of the globe, and to their formation in मेरीटाइम tropical air masses.
The term `` cyclone '' refers to such storms ' cyclonic nature, with counterclockwise wind flow in the उत्तरी Hemisphere and clockwise wind flow in the Southern गोलार्ध.
The opposite direction of the wind flow is a परिणाम of the Coriolis force.
Depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by names such as hurricane (, ), typhoon ( ), tropical storm, cyclonic तूफ़ान, tropical depression, and simply cyclone.
While tropical cyclones can produce अत्यधिक शक्तिशाली winds and torrential rain, they are also able to produce high लहरें, damaging storm surge, and tornadoes.
They develop over large bodies of warm water, और lose their strength if they move over land due to increased surface friction and loss of the गरम समंदर as an energy source.
This is why coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone, while inland regions are relatively safe from receiving strong winds.
Heavy rains, however, can produce significant flooding inland, and storm surges can produce extensive coastal flooding up to from the coastline.
Although their effects on human populations can be विनाशकारी, tropical cyclones can relieve drought conditions.
They also carry heat उर्जा away इससे the tropics और transport it toward temperate latitudes, which makes them an important part of the global वायुमंडलीय circulation यांत्रिकी.
As a result, तीव्र cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth 's troposphere, and to maintain a relatively stable and warm temperature worldwide.
Many tropical cyclones develop when the atmospheric शर्तें around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable.
The background पर्यावरण is modulated by climatological cycles and patterns such as the Madden-Julian oscillation, El Niño-Southern Oscillation, and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation.
Others form when other types of cyclones acquire तीव्र विशेषताएँ.
Tropical प्रणालियों are then moved by steering हवाएँ in the troposphere ; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye.
On the other end of the spectrum, if the शर्तें around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates.
It is not possible to artificially induce the dissipation of these systems with current technology.

Richard Milhous Nixon ( January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994 ) was the 37th President of the United States, serving from 1969 to 1974, when he became the only president to resign the office.
निक्सन had previously served as a Republican U.S. representative and senator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United राज्य from 1953 to 1961.
Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California.
He graduated from Whittier College in 1934 और Duke University School of Law in 1937, returning to California to practice law.
He and his बीवी, Pat Nixon, moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942.
He subsequently served in the United States Navy during World War II.
Nixon was elected in California to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the सीनेट in 1950.
His pursuit of the Alger hiss मामला established his प्रतिष्ठा as a leading anti-communist, and elevated him to national prominence.
He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election.

The Dominican Republic annexation treaty caused bitter contention between President Grant and Sen. Sumner.
Brady 1869 ] ]
Sen. Sumner, opposed to American imperialism in the Caribbean and fearful that annexation would lead to the conquest of the neighboring black republic of Haiti, became convinced that corruption lay behind the treaty, और that men close to the president shared in the corruption.
As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sen. Sumner initially withheld उसके opinion on the treaty on January 18, 1870.
Sen. Sumner had been leaked information from Assistant Secretary of State, Bancroft Davis, कि U.S. Naval ships were being used to protect President Báez.
Sen. Sumner 's committee voted against annexation and at Sen. Sumner’s suggestion and quite possibly to save the party from an ugly fight or the president from embarrassment, the Senate held its बहस of the treaty behind closed doors in executive session.
President Grant persisted and sent messages to Congress in favor of annexation on March 14, 1870, and May 31, 1870.
In closed session, Sen. Sumner spoke out against the treaty ; warnng that there would be difficulty with the foreign nationals, noting the chronic विद्रोह that took place on the द्वीप, and the risk that the independence of हैती, recognized by the United States in 1862, would be lost.
Sumner stated कि Grant 's use of the U.S. Navy as a protectorate was a violation of International law and unconstitutional.
Finally, on जून 30, 1870 the treaty was voted on by the Senate and failed to gain the required 2/3 majority for treaty passage.
The following day, President ग्रान्ट, feeling betrayed by Sen. Sumner, retaliated by ordering the dismissal of Sumner’s close friend J. lothrop Motley, Ambassador to Britain.
By autumn, Sumner 's personal hostility to the president was public knowledge, and he blamed the Secretary of State for failing to have resigned, rather than let Grant have his way.
The two मेन, friends until then, cooled into bitter enemies.
In December, 1870, still fearful that Grant meant to acquire Santo Domingo somehow, Sumner gave a fiercely critical speech accusing the president of usurpation and Babcock of unethical conduct.
Already, President Grant, supported by his सचिव of State Hamilton Fish, had initiated a अभियान to depose Sumner from the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Although Sumner stated he was an `` Administration man '', in addition to having stopped Grant 's Dominican Republic treaty attempt, Sumner had defeated Grant 's full repeal of the Tenure of Office Act, अवरोधित Grant 's nomination of Alexander Stewart to U.S. Secretary of Treasury, and been a constant harassing force pushing Reconstruction policies faster than Grant had been willing to go.
Grant resented Sumner 's superiority of manner, as well.
Told once कि Sumner did not believe in the Bible, the president is supposed to have said that he was not surprised : `` he did n't write it. ''
As the rift between Grant and Sumner increased, sumner’s health began to decline.
When the 42nd U.S. Congress convened on March 4, 1871, सीनेटरों affiliated with President Grant, known as ‘’New Radicals’’ voted to oust Sen. Sumner from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairmanship.
Business ethics ( also corporate ethics ) is a form of applied ethics or professional ethics that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that उठता in a business environment.
It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire संगठन.
Business ethics has both normative and descriptive dimensions.
As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative.
Academics attempting to समझे business behavior employ descriptive methods.
The दायरा and quantity of business ethical issues reflects the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns.
Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s और 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia.
For उदाहरण, आज most major corporations promote उनके commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters.
Adam स्मिथ कहा, `` People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. ''
Governments use laws and regulations to point कारोबार behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial दिशानिर्देश.
Ethics implicitly regulates areas और details of behavior that lie beyond governmental कंट्रोल.
The emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal आचार regimes.
A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation.
Most burns affect only the superficial skin ( known as superficial or first degree ) or extend into the deeper skin but do not involve the full thickness of the skin ( known as partial thickness or second उपाधि ).
Rarely all layers of the skin or deeper tissues, such as मांसपेशी or bone can be injured in which case the burn is either full thickness ( तीसरा degree ) or fourth degree.
the treatment required depends on the severity of the burn.
Superficial burns संभवतः managed with little more than सरल pain killers while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers.
Cooling साथ tap water may aid पीड़ा and decrease damage however if exposure is prolonged it may result in low देह temperature.
Partial मोटाई burns may require cleaning साथ साबुन and water followed by dressings.
Blisters should typically be बाएँ unbroken.
Full thickness burns usually आवश्यकता surgical treatments such as skin grafting and extensive burns often require large amount of intravenous fluids.
The सबसे common complications of burns are related to infection.
While large burns can be fatal, modern treatments developed in the last 50 years have significantly improved the outcomes, especially in children and young adults.
Globally about 11 million people seek medical treatment और 300,000 people die from burns.
In the United States, of those admitted to a burn center, approximately 4 % die from their injuries.
The long term निष्कर्ष is primarily related to the size of burn and the age of the person effected.
The Atlantic Ocean, not including Arctic and Antarctic regions
This video was taken by the crew of Expedition 29 on board the ISS.
The pass starts from just north-east of the Island of न्यूफ़ाउंडलैंड over the North Atlantic Ocean to सेंट्रल Africa, over South Sudan.
The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world 's oceanic divisions.
With a total area of about, it covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth 's surface और about 29 percent of its water surface area.
The first part of its name refers to Atlas of Greek mythology, making the Atlantic the `` Sea of Atlas ''.
the oldest known mention of `` Atlantic '' is in The histories of Herodotus around 450 bc ( Hdt. 1.202.4 ) : Atlantis thalassa ( Greek : Ἀτλαντὶς θάλασσα ; English : Sea of Atlas ).
The term Ethiopic Ocean, derived from Ethiopia, was applied to the southern अटलांटिक as late as the mid-19th century.
Before Europeans discovered other oceans, the term `` ocean '' itself was synonymous with the waters beyond the Strait of Gibraltar that we अभी know as the Atlantic.
The early Greeks believed this समंदर to be a gigantic river encircling the world.
The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Eurasia and Africa to the east, and the Americas to the west.
As one component of the interconnected global ocean, it is कनेक्ट in the north to the Arctic Ocean ( which is sometimes माना a sea of the Atlantic ), to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, और the Southern Ocean in the south.
( Other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica. )
The equator subdivides it into the North Atlantic समंदर and South Atlantic Ocean.
Due to their long-term persistence, and the need for a unique identifier in issuing forecasts and चेतावनियाँ, tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones are given names according to policy ( देखिए Tropical चक्रवात naming ).
The following are lists from which these तीव्र and subtropical cyclone names are derived.
White लाइट is dispersed by a prism into the colors of the optical spectrum.
The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to ( can be detected by ) the human eye.
इलेक्ट्रोमैग्नेटिक radiation in this दायरा of wavelengths is called visible लाइट or बस light.
A typical इंसान eye will respond to wavelengths from about 390 to 700 nm.
In शर्तें of frequency, this corresponds to a बैंड in the vicinity of 430–790 thz.
A light-adapted eye generally has इसके maximum sensitivity at around 555 nm ( 540 THz ), in the green region of the optical वर्णक्रम ( see : दीप्ति function ).
The वर्णक्रम does not, however, contain all the colors that the human eyes and brain can distinguish.
Unsaturated colors such as pink, or purple variations such as magenta, are अनुपस्थित, for example, because they can be made only by a mix of multiple wavelengths.
Colors containing तभी one wavelength are also called pure colors.
Visible wavelengths pass through the `` optical window ``, the region of the electromagnetic spectrum which allows wavelengths to pass largely unattenuated through the Earth 's atmosphere.
An example of this phenomenon is that clean air scatters blue light more than red wavelengths, और so the midday आसमान appears blue.
The optical खिड़की is also called the visible window because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum.
The near infrared ( NIR ) window lies just out of the human vision, as well as the मीडियम Wavelength IR ( MWIR ) window and the Long Wavelength or Far Infrared ( LWIR or FIR ) window though other animals may experience them.
अनेक species can see light with बारंबारता outside the `` visible spectrum, '' which is defined in terms of human vision.
Bees and many other insects can detect ultraviolet लाइट, which helps them find nectar in flowers.
Plant species कि depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to their appearance in ultraviolet लाइट, rather than how colorful they appear to humans.
Birds, too, can see into the ultraviolet ( 300–400 nm ), and कुछ have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range.
Many animals that can see into the ultraviolet range, however, can not see red light or any other reddish wavelengths.
Bees ' visible spectrum ends at about 590nm, just before the नारंगी wavelengths start.
Birds, however, can see some red wavelengths, लकिन not as many as humans.
Zebras ( or ) are several species of African equids ( horse family ) united by their distinctive black and white stripes.
Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each व्यक्तिगत.
They are generally social animals that live in छोटी harems to large herds.
Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses, zebras have never been truly domesticated.
There are three species of zebras : the plains zebra, the Grévy 's zebra and the mountain zebra.
the plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris, but Grévy 's zebra is the एकमात्र species of subgenus Dolichohippus.
The latter resembles an ass, to which it is closely related, while the former two are more horse-like.
All three belong to the genus Equus, along with other living equids.
The unique stripes of zebras make them one of the animals most familiar to people.
They occur in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains, और coastal hills.

The shell letters K, L, M,..., used in the x-ray notation, हैं alphabetical.
प्रत्येक शेल can contain तभी a fixed number of electrons : the 1st shell can hold up to two electrons, the 2nd shell can hold up to eight electrons, the 3rd shell can hold up to 18, and 4th shell can hold up to 32 and so on.
चूंकि electrons are electrically attracted to the nucleus, an atom 's electrons will generally occupy outer shells only if the more inner shells have already been completely filled by अन्य electrons.
However, this is not a सख्त requirement : Atoms may have two or even three incomplete outer shells.
( See Madelung rule for more details. )
For an explanation of why electrons exist in these शेल see electron configuration.
The electrons in the outermost occupied shell ( or shells ) determine the chemical properties of the atom ; it is पुकारा the valence shell.

From ca. 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in 1532, selective प्रजनन by indigenous South American peoples resulted in many varieties of domestic Guinea pigs, which रूप the आधार लिये some of the modern domestic breeds.
Early Andean breeds were primarily kept as agricultural stock for food, and efforts at improving the गिनी pig as a खाना source continue to the modern era.
With the export of Guinea pigs to यूरोपीय in the 15th century, the goal in breeding shifted to focus on the development of appealing pets.
To this end, various competitive प्रजनन organizations were founded by fanciers.
The American Cavy Breeders Association, an adjunct to the American Rabbit प्रजनक Association, is the governing body in the United States and Canada.
The British Cavy Council governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom.
Similar organizations मौजूद in Australia ( Australian National Cavy परिषद ) and New Zealand ( New Zealand Cavy Club ).
Each club publishes its अपना Standard of Perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing.
New breeds continue to emerge in the 21st century.
Though there हैं many breeds of Guinea pig, only a few breeds are commonly found on the show table as pets.
Most Guinea pigs found as pets were either found undesirable by प्रजनक or were करवाया to be pleasant pets regardless of how well they मिलें the breed मानक of perfection.
The short hair, Abyssinian, Peruvian and Sheltie ( aka Silkie ) breeds are those most frequently देखी as pets, and the former three are the core breeds in the history of the competitive showing of Guinea pigs.
In जोड to their standard form, nearly all breeds come in a Satin variant.
Satins, due to their hollow hair shafts, possess coats of a special gloss and shine.
However, there is growing evidence that the genes responsible for the साटन coat also can cause severe bone समस्याएं, including Osteodystrophy and Paget 's disease.
प्रर्दशित Satin variations is prohibited by some cavy breeders ' एसोसिएशन because of animal welfare reasons.

The body should be strong and of compact build.
Coat colour should in all variations be clearly defined and thorough from root to tip.
These standards are best met by long established, commonly bred breeds, as उनके breeders have had enough time and animals to effectively breed for these qualities.
The coat colour आदर्श of good definition and thoroughness is rarely met by other than the smooth coated breeds, which have had खूब established, separate breeding lines for different colours.
State schools ( also known as पब्लिक schools or government schools ) generally refer to primary or द्वितीयक schools mandated for or offered to all children बगैर charge सशुल्क for, in whole or in part, by taxation.
the term may also refer to institutions of post-secondary education funded, in whole or in part, और overseen by government.
the ribosome assembles polymeric protein molecules whose sequence is controlled by the sequence of messenger RNA molecules.
This is required by all living cells और संबद्ध viruses.
The ribosome ( from ribonucleic acid और the Greek soma, meaning `` body '' ) is a large and complex molecular machine, found within all living cells, that serves as the प्राथमिक site of biological protein synthesis ( translation ).
Ribosomes link amino acids together in the अनुक्रम specified by messenger RNA ( mrna ) molecules.
Ribosomes consist of two major subunits—the छोटी ribosomal subunit पढ़े the mRNA, while the विशाल subunit joins amino acids to form a polypeptide कड़ी.
Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) molecules and a variety of proteins.
The sequence of DNA एन्कोडिंग for a protein may be copied many times into messenger RNA ( mRNA ) chains of a समान sequence.
ribosomes can bind to an mRNA कड़ी and use it as a template for determining the correct अनुक्रम of amino acids in a particular protein.
Amino acids are selected, collected and carried to the ribosome by transfer RNA ( tRNA molecules ), which enter one part of the ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chain.
The attached अमीनो acids are then linked together by another part of the ribosome.
Once the protein is produced, it can then 'fold ' to produce a specific functional three-dimensional ढांचा.
A राइबोसोम is made from complexes of RNAs and proteins and is इसलिए a ribonucleoprotein.
Each ribosome is divided into two subunits : the smaller subunit binds to the mRNA pattern, while the larger subunit binds to the tRNA and the amino acids.
When a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA अणु, these two subunits split apart.
Ribosomes are ribozymes, because the catalytic peptidyl transferase activity that links amino acids साथ is performed by the ribosomal RNA.
ribosomes from जीवाणु, archaea and eukaryotes ( the three domains of life on Earth ) differ in their size, sequence, structure, and the ratio of protein to RNA.
The differences in structure allow some एंटीबायोटिक to मार bacteria by inhibiting their ribosomes, while leaving human ribosomes unaffected.
In bacteria and archaea, more than one राइबोसोम may मूव along a single mRNA chain at one time, each `` reading '' its sequence and producing a corresponding protein molecule.
The ribosomes in the mitochondria of eukaryotic कोशिकाएं functionally resemble many features of those in bacteria, reflecting the likely evolutionary origin of mitochondria.
अल्बर्ट Claude, Christian de Duve, and George Emil Palade were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, in 1974, for the discovery of the ribosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 was awarded to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas A. Steitz and Ada E. Yonath for determining the detailed structure and mechanism of the ribosome.

Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation
The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis are chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into ग्लूकोज.
These प्रतिक्रियाएँ occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside of the thylakoid झिल्लियों.
These reactions take the light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them.
There are three phases to the light-independent reactions, collectively called the calvin cycle : carbon fixation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate ( RuBP ) regeneration.
Despite its name, इस प्रक्रम occurs only जब light is available.
Plants do not carry out the Calvin cycle by night.
They, instead, release sucrose into the फ्लोएम from their starch reserves.
इस process happens when लाइट is उपलब्धियाँ independent of the kind of photosynthesis ( C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation, और Crassulacean Acid Metabolism ) ; CAM plants store malic acid in उनके vacuoles every night and release it by day in order to make this process work.
In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer ; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
लिये example, 9 is a square number, since it can be written as.
the usual notation for the formula for the square of a number is not the product, but the equivalent exponentiation, usually pronounced as `` squared ''.
The name वर्गाकार number आता from the name of the shape ; see below.
Square numbers are non-negative.
Another way of saying that a ( non-negative ) number is a square number, is that इसके square roots are again integers.
For example, = ±3, so 9 is a square number.
A positive पूर्णांक that has no perfect square divisors except 1 is called square-free.
For a non-negative integer, the th square number is, with being the zeroth square.
The concept of square can be extended to some other number systems.
If rational numbers are included, then a square is the ratio of two square integers, and, conversely, the ratio of two square integers is a वर्गाकार ( e.g., 4/9 = ( 2/3 ) 2 ).
Starting with 1, there are square numbers up to and including, where the expression represents the floor of the number.
the Era of Good Feelings marked a period in the political history of the United States that reflected a भाव of national purpose and a desire for unity among Americans in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars.
The era saw the पतन of the Federalist Party and an end to the bitter partisan विवादों between it and the dominant Democratic-Republican party during the First Party System.
President James Monroe endeavored to downplay partisan affiliation in बनाना his nominations, with the ultimate goal of national unity और eliminating parties altogether from national politics.
The period is so closely associated with Monroe 's presidency ( 1817–1825 ) and his administrative goals that his name और the era are virtually synonymous.
The Era of Good जज्बात marked a transition in अमरीकी politics with the end of the Federalist Party as America began to develop after the War of 1812.
While America थी experiencing growth और prosperity after the war with Britain, इस era also marks the first instance of economic troubles in the growing United States.
Mirroring the American System proposed by हेनरी Clay, protective tariffs and the chartering of the Second Bank of the United States complicated the tension between the North and South with the coming of the first financial crisis.
While the term “Era of Good Feelings” is usually viewed with irony because of the political turmoil, economic factors caused animosity between the North and South.
The designation of the period by historians as एक of “good feelings” is often conveyed with irony or skepticism, as the history of the era was one in which the political atmosphere was strained and divisive, विशेषकर among factions within the Monroe administration and the Republican Party.
The phrase “Era of Good Feelings” was coined by Benjamin Russell, in the Boston Federalist newspaper, Columbian Centinel, on July 12, 1817, following Monroe 's विज़िट to Boston, Massachusetts as part of his good will tour of America.
Mariel Margaret `` Mia '' Hamm ( born March 17, 1972 ) is a retired American पेशेवर soccer player.
hamm played many सालो as a forward लिये the United States women 's national soccer team और was a founding member of the Washington Freedom.
Hamm scored 158 international goals, more than any other player, पुरूष or female, in the history of soccer and is the third most capped female player in soccer history behind Kristine Lilly and Christie Rampone, appearing in 275 international matches.
Hamm was नामित the women 's FIFA World Player of the Year the first दो times that award was given ( in 2001 and 2002 ), and is listed as one of FIFA 's 125 best living players ( as chosen by Pelé ).
She was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame as well as the Alabama Sports Hall of कीर्ति and Texas Sports Hall of Fame.
She is the author of Go For the Goal : A चैंपियन 's मार्गदर्शिका to Winning in Soccer and Life and appeared in the एचबीओ documentary Dare to Dream : The Story of the u.S. महिलाओं 's Soccer Team.
Washington Post columnist Michael Wilbon called hamm, `` शायद the most important athlete of the last 15 years. ''

The New York Red Bulls is an अमरीकी professional soccer team based in Harrison, New Jersey, representing the New यॉर्क metropolitan area.
The team competes in the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer ( MLS ).
It is one of the ten charter clubs of MLS, having competed in the league since its inception.
The team थी a founding सदस्य of MLS ( 1996 ), but has gone through several name changes.
the टोली was originally known as the New York/New जर्सी metrostars through 1997.
From the 1998 season through the 2005 season, the team was ज्ञात as the MetroStars.
On March 9, 2006, the team was sold to Red सांड GmbH, leading to the team 's current नाम.
They are the तभी original MLS मताधिकार not to have won any significant trophy ( including regular season, playoffs, and knockout competition ) since inception.
The team 's best result in the MLS थी the MLS Cup final in 2008.
In the us Open Cup, the MetroStars reached three semifinals ( 1997, 1998, 2000 ), before reaching their first final in 2003, losing 1–0 to the शिकागो Fire.
On August 26, 2000, the Metros ' Clint Mathis नियत an MLS record by स्कोरिंग five goals in a game against the डलास Burn.
कुछ well-known players that have played for the team include Giovanni Savarese, Tim Howard, Tony Meola, Tab ramos, Alexi Lalas, Clint Mathis, Jozy Altidore, Michael Bradley, क्लाउडियो Reyna, Eddie Pope, Roberto donadoni, Lothar Matthäus, Adolfo Valencia, Youri Djorkaeff, Amado Guevara, Juan Pablo Ángel, Thierry Henry, Juninho Pernambucano, Jan Gunnar Solli, Rafael Márquez, and Tim Cahill.
The team has also had well-known coaches, including Carlos Queiroz, Carlos Alberto Parreira, Bora milutinović, Bob Bradley, mo Johnston, Bruce Arena and Hans Backe.
Confucianism, Taoism, और Buddhism are one, a painting in the litang style portraying three men laughing by a river stream, 12th century, Song Dynasty.
Estimating the number of Buddhists in the world, or in many countries, is difficult due to definitional issues as well as practical problems of enumeration.
To शुरू with, the religious beliefs, practices, and identities of East Asians ( who comprise the majority of the world 's Buddhists by कोई measure ) often blend Buddhism with other traditions including Confucianism, the Chinese folk religion, Daoism, Shinto, and Korean shamanism.
Most followers of Buddhism do not belong to structured congregations, or observe a definite ritual of adherence ऐसे as taking Refuge, making it difficult to accurately estimate the number of practitioners.
An additional challenge is the दुश्मनी of several नेशनल सरकारें ( often Communist ones such as China or North Korea ) to religion generally or to Buddhism specifically.
Government policies in these countries may encourage the under-reporting or non-reporting of religious adherence, resulting in official totals that may drastically underestimate the number of religious practitioners in these countries.
Estimate of the विश्वव्यापी Buddhist population range from 350 million to over one billion, but cluster nearer to the first figure.
adherents.com ( as of 2012 ) suggests a figure of 397 million.
By प्रमुख branches, the संख्याएँ are as follows:
( 1 ) Mahayana Buddhism, including ईस्ट एशियाई Buddhism, with no कम than 185 million adherents, and possibly several times that many ( again, depending on definitional issues ).
This is the predominant form of Buddhism practiced in China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam.
( 2 ) Theravada Buddhism, with no fewer than 125 million adherents.
This is the predominant form of buddhism practiced in Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Sri लंका, and Burma.
( 3 ) Vajrayana Buddhism, with approximately 20 million adherents.
This form predominates in the greater Tibetan and Mongolian regions, as well as in the Himalayas.
Besides the स्वतंत्र countries of Mongolia and भूटान, and various territories within what is now western China, वज्रयान is traditional to certain regions of Russia ( e.g. Kalmykia, बुर्यातिया ), India ( e.g. Ladakh, Sikkim ), and Nepal ( e.g. Khumbu ).
Vajrayana, also known as तिब्बती Buddhism, is प्रायः conflated with Tantric Buddhism, but this is imprecise, as Shingon और अन्य फ़ॉर्म of East एशियाई Buddhism also अभ्यास tantra.
At least 7 countries ( Sri लंका, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Bhutan, and Mongolia ) have unambiguous Buddhist majorities.
Depending on how one calculates चाइनीज and other East Asian adherents, this figure might विस्तार to include several more countries.
In addition, Buddhism is the state religion of Cambodia and Bhutan, and receives prominent mention in the constitutions of Thailand और Sri Lanka.
In उत्तरी India and Nepal, the land where Buddhism was born, the religion severely declined during the first millennium.
Whether इस decline was due to the इस्लामी conquest of northern India, or to other factors, remains controversial.
See the article Decline of Buddhism in India.
James Butler Hickok ( May 27, 1837 – August 2, 1876 ), better known as Wild Bill Hickok, was a folk hero of the American Old West.
His skills as a gunfighter and scout, along with his reputation as a lawman, provided the basis for his fame, although some of his reported exploits are fictionalized.
Born and raised on a farm in rural इलिनोइस, Hickok went west at age 18 as a fugitive from justice, पहला working as a stagecoach driver, before he became a lawman in the frontier territories of Kansas and Nebraska.
He fought for the Union Army during the American Civil War, and gained publicity after the war as a scout, marksman, actor, and professional gambler.
Between उसके law-enforcement duties and gambling, which easily overlapped, Hickok was involved in several notable shootouts.
He was shot and killed while playing poker in the Nuttal & मन 's Saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory ( now South डकोटा ).
Artist 's conception of the Curiosity rover vaporizing rock on Mars.
The rover landed on Mars in August 2012.
A Mars rover is an automated motor vehicle which propels itself across the surface of the planet Mars after landing.
Rovers have several लाभ over stationary landers : they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features, they can प्लेस themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control.
There have been four successful robotically operated Mars rovers.
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed the Mars Pathfinder mission and its now inactive Sojourner rover.
It currently manages the Mars Exploration रोवर mission 's active Opportunity rover and inactive Spirit, and, as भाग of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, the Curiosity rover.
A financial audit, or more accurately, an audit of financial statements, is the verification of the financial statements of a legal entity, with a view to express an audit opinion.
the audit opinion is intended to provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, that the financial statements हैं presented fairly, in all material respects, and/or give a true और fair view in accordance with the financial reporting framework.
The purpose of an audit is provide and objective independent examination of the financial statements, which increases the value and credibility of the financial statements produced by प्रबन्धन, thus increase उपयोक्ता confidence in the financial statement, reduce investor risk and consequently reduce the cost of capital of the preparer of the financial statements.
Financial audits are typically performed by firms of practicing accountants who are experts in financial reporting.
The financial audit is one of many परख functions provided by accounting firms.
Many organizations separately employ or hire internal auditors, who do not attest to financial reports but focus mainly on the internal नियंत्रण of the organization.
External auditors may चुनें to place limited reliance on the work of internal auditors.
Auditing promotes transparency and accuracy in the financial disclosures made by an organization, therefore would likely to reduce of such corporations to conceal unscrupulous dealings.
Internationally, the International Standards on Auditing ( ISA ) issued by the International Auditing और Assurance Standards Board ( IAASB ) is considered as the benchmark लिये audit process.
Almost all jurisdictions require auditors to follow the isa or a local variation of the ISA.
Dollar coins have been minted in the United States in gold, silver, and base metal versions.
the term silver dollar is often used for any large white metal coin issued by the United States with a face value of one dollar, although purists insist that a डालर is not silver unless it contains some of that metal.
Silver डॉलर, the first dollar coin issue, were minted beginning in 1794.
Gold dollars and gold-colored dollars have also been produced by the United States.
The Sacagawea and Presidential dollars are often referred to as `` golden dollars ''.
In modern टाइम्स, dollar coins have not been very लोकप्रिय in the United States.
Despite efforts by the government to promote their use, most Americans currently use the one dollar bill rather than dollar coins.
In straight और स्तर flight lift ( L ) equals weight ( W ).
In a banked turn of 60°, lift equals double the weight ( L=2W ).
The pilot experiences 2g and a doubled weight.
The steeper the bank, the greater the g-forces.
इस top-fuel dragster can accelerate from zero to in 0.86 seconds.
इस is a horizontal acceleration of 5.3 g. Combined with the vertical g-force in the stationary मामला the pythagorean theorem yields a g force of 5.4 g.
g-force ( with g इससे gravitational ) is a term for accelerations लगा as weight and measurable by accelerometers.
It is not a force, per se, but a force per unit mass.
Since such a force is perceived as a weight, any g-force can be described as a `` weight per unit mass '' ( see the synonym specific weight ).
The g-force त्वरण acts as a multiplier of weight-like forces for every unit of an object 's mass, and ( save for certain electromagnetic force influences ) is the cause of an object 's acceleration in संबंध to free-fall.
This acceleration experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of non-gravitational forces acting on an object free to move.
The accelerations कि are not produced by gravity are termed proper accelerations, and it is only these that are measured in g-force इकाई.
They cause stresses and strains on objects.
Because of these strains, विशाल g-forces may be destructive.
Gravitation acting alone does not produce a g-force, even though g-forces are expressed in multiples of the acceleration of a standard gravity.
Thus, the standard gravitational acceleration at the Earth 's surface produces g-force only indirectly, as a result of resistance to it by mechanical forces.
The 1 g-force on an object sitting on the Earth 's surface is caused by mechanical force exerted in the upward direction by the ground, keeping the object इससे going into free-fall.
the upward force from the ground ensures that an object at rest on the Earth 's surface is accelerating relative to the free-fall condition, which is the path that the object would follow when falling freely toward the Earth 's center.
Objects allowed to free-fall in an inertial trajectory under the influence of gravitation-only, महसूस no g-force.
This is demonstrated by the `` zero-g '' शर्तें inside a freely falling elevator falling toward the Earth 's center ( in vacuum ), or ( to good approximation ) conditions inside a spacecraft in Earth orbit.
These are उदाहरण of निर्देशांक acceleration ( a change in velocity ) without a sensation of weight.
The experience of no g-force ( zero-g ), however it is produced, is synonymous with weightlessness.
In the absence of gravitational fields, or in directions at right angles to them, proper and coordinate accelerations हैं the same, and any coordinate acceleration must be produced by a सम्बन्धित g-force acceleration.
An example here is a rocket in free space, in which simple changes in velocity are produced by the engines, and produce g-forces on the rocket and passengers.
an augur holding a lituus, the curved wand often प्रयुक्त as a symbol of augury on Roman coins
The augur was a priest and official in the classical world, especially ancient Rome and Etruria.
His main role was to interpret the will of the gods by studying the flight of birds : whether they are flying in समूह or alone, what noises they make as they fly, direction of flight and what kind of birds वे are.
This was known as `` taking the auspices. ''
The ceremony and function of the augur was central to any major undertaking in Roman society—public or private—including matters of war, commerce, and religion.
the Roman historian Livy stresses the importance of the augurs : `` Who does not know कि this city was founded only बाद taking the auspices, that everything in war and in peace, at home और abroad, was किया only after taking the auspices ? ''
farmington Hills is an affluent community in southeastern Michigan.
It is the second largest city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan.
Its population was 79,740 at the 2010 census.
It is part of the upscale northwestern suburbs of Metropolitan Detroit and is also northeast of downtown Ann Arbor.
Farmington Hills consistently ranks as one of the safest शहरों in the United States, as well as in the state of Michigan.
In 2010, the area ranked as the 30th safest city in America.
हालांकि the two cities have separate services and addresses, Farmington and Farmington Hills are often thought of as the same community.
Features of the community include a recently renovated downtown, boutiques, a विंटेज cinema, numerous restaurants, exotic car dealerships, art galleries, and public parks including Heritage Park.
There are अनेक historical साइट including the longacre House and the Governor Warner Mansion.

Farmington Hills serves as a major business center for the greater Detroit area.
Present-day impression of a Late Bronze Age मुहर
Town seal ( matrix ) of Náchod from 1570
A seal is a device for making an impression in wax, clay, paper, or some other medium, including an embossment on paper, and is also the impression thus बना.
The original purpose was to authenticate a document, a wrapper for एक such as a modern envelope, or the कवर of a container or package holding valuables or other objects.
The sealing process is essentially that of a mould, with the final image represented on the device for making the impression by a mirror-image design, incised in sunken- ( or counter- ) relief or intaglio.
The seal-making device is also referred to as the seal matrix or die ; the imprint it creates as the seal impression ( or, more rarely, the sealing ).
If the छाप is made purely as a relief resulting from the greater pressure on the paper where the high parts of the मेट्रिक्स touch, the seal is known as a dry seal ; in all other cases a liquid or liquified medium ( such as ink or wax ) is प्रयुक्त, usually in another color than the paper.
For विधिक purposes, the definition of a seal may be extended to include rubber stamps, or writing specified शब्द ( `` seal '' or `` L.S. `` ).
In the United States, the word `` seal '' is sometimes assigned to a facsimile of the seal design ( in monochrome or color ), which may be used in a variety of contexts सहित architectural settings, on flags, or on आधिकारिक letterheads.
Thus, for example, the Great Seal of the United States, among other uses, appears on the reverse of the one-dollar bill ; और several of the seals of the U.S. states appear on their respective state flags.
In Europe, although coats of arms and heraldic badges may well feature in such contexts as खूब as on seals, the मुहर design in its entirety rarely appears as an emblem.
The पढ़ाई of seals is known as sigillography or sphragistics.
Groundhog Day ( Pennsylvania German : Grundsaudaag, murmeltiertag ) is a day celebrated on February 2.
According to folklore, if it is cloudy when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on इस day, then spring होगा come early ; if it is sunny, the groundhog will माना see इसके छाया and रिट्रीट back into its burrow, and the winter weather will continue for six more weeks.
Modern customs of the holiday involve जश्न where early morning festivals are held to watch the groundhog emerging from its burrow.
In southeastern Pennsylvania, groundhog Lodges ( Grundsow Lodges ) celebrate the holiday साथ fersommlinge, social events in which food is served, speeches are made, and one or more g'spiel ( plays or skits ) are performed for entertainment.
The Pennsylvania German dialect is the only language spoken at the event, and those who speak English pay a दंड, usually in the form of a nickel, dime, or quarter प्रति शब्द बोला, with the money put into a bowl in the center of the table.
The largest Groundhog दिन celebration is held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.
Groundhog Day, already a widely recognized and popular tradition, received widespread attention as a result of the 1993 फिल्मी Groundhog Day, which was set in Punxsutawney, PA ( though फिल्माया primarily in Woodstock, IL ) और portrayed Punxsutawney Phil.
High resolution image of tampa Bay region
The Tampa Bay area रै a humid subtropical climate ( Koppen cfa ), with गरम and humid summers with frequent thunderstorms and drier winters with जमने temperatures occurring every 2–3 years.
the area experiences a significant summer wet season, as nearly two-thirds of the annual precipitation falls in the months of June through September.
The area is listed by the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) as being in hardiness zone 10, which is about the northern सीमा of where coconut palms और royal palms can be grown.
Highs usually range between 65 and 95 °F ( 18 and 35 °C ) year round.
Though known for hot summers, Tampa 's official high has never reached 100 °F ( 38 °C ) – the नगर 's all-time record temperature is 99 °F ( 37 °C ).
St. Petersburg 's all-time record high is exactly 100 °F ( 38 °C ).
Pinellas County lies on a peninsula between Tampa Bay and the गल्फ of Mexico, and much of the city of Tampa lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay.
This proximity to large bodies of water both moderates temperatures and introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere.
In general, the लोकल communities farthest from the coast have larger temperature ranges, दोनो during a single day and throughout the seasons of the year.
A diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum, showing various properties across the range of frequencies and wavelengths
The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all संभावित frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.
The `` electromagnetic spectrum '' of an object has a different meaning, and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular ऑब्जेक्ट.
The electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern radio communication to gamma विकिरण at the short- wavelength ( high-frequency ) end, thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a भिन्न of the size of an atom.
The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself, while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length, although in principle the वर्णक्रम is infinite and continuous.
Most parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are used in science for spectroscopic and other probing interactions, as ways to study and characterize matter.
In addition, radiation from various parts of the spectrum has found many other uses for communications and manufacturing ( see electromagnetic radiation for more applications ).
Legend
Franklin Delano Roosevelt ( or ; January 30, 1882 – April 12, 1945 ), also known by his initials, FDR, was the 32nd President of the United States ( 1933–1945 ) and a central figure in world events during the mid-20th century, leading the United States during a time of worldwide आर्थिक depression and कुल युद्ध.
A dominant leader of the Democratic Party and the only American president elected to अधिक than two terms, he निर्मित a New Deal Coalition that realigned American politics after 1932, as his domestic policies defined American liberalism for the middle third of the 20th century.
With the bouncy popular सोंग `` Happy Days Are Here Again `` as his अभियान theme, FDR defeated incumbent Republican Herbert Hoover in November 1932, at the depth of the Great Depression.
Energized by his personal victory over पोलियो, FDR 's unfailing optimism and सक्रियता contributed to a नवीकरण of the national spirit.
He worked closely साथ British Prime Minister Winston Churchill और Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin in leading the Allies against Germany and Japan in World War II, और restoring prosperity to the nation 's economy.
In his first hundred days in office, which began March 4, 1933, Roosevelt spearheaded major legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal —a variety of programs designed to produce relief ( government jobs for the बेरोजगार ), recovery ( economic growth ), and reform ( through विनियमन of Wall Street, banks and transportation ).
The economy improved rapidly from 1933 to 1937, but then relapsed into a deep recession.
the bipartisan Conservative Coalition that formed in 1937 prevented his packing the Supreme अदालत or passing कोई considerable legislation ; it abolished many of the relief programs जब बेरोजगारी diminished during World War II.
सबसे of the regulations on कारोबार were ended about 1975–85, except for the विनियमन of वॉल Street by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which still exists.
Along with several smaller कार्यक्रम, major surviving programs include the संघीय Deposit Insurance Corporation, which was created in 1933, and Social Security, which Congress passed in 1935.
As World War II loomed after 1938, साथ the Japanese invasion of चीन and the aggression of Nazi Germany, FDR दिया strong diplomatic and financial support to China and Great Britain, while remaining officially neutral.
His goal was to make America the `` Arsenal of Democracy `` which would supply munitions to the Allies.
In March 1941, Roosevelt, with Congressional approval, provided Lend-Lease aid to the countries fighting against Nazi Germany with Britain.
With very strong national support, he made war on Japan and Germany after the Japanese attack on पर्ल Harbor on December 7, 1941, calling it a `` date which will live in infamy ``.
He supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the Allied war प्रयत्न.
As an क्रियाशील सैन्य leader, Roosevelt implemented an overall war strategy on two fronts that ended in the defeat of the Axis शक्तियां and the development of the संसार 's first atom bomb.
In 1942 Roosevelt ordered the internment of 100,000 Japanese American नागरिकों.
Unemployment dropped to 2 %, relief कार्यक्रम largely ended, and the industrial economy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people स्थानांतरित to new कार्य in war centers, and 16 million men and 300,000 women were drafted or volunteered for military service.
Roosevelt वर्चस्व the American political scene not only during the twelve years of his presidency, but also for दशकों afterward.
He orchestrated the realignment of voters that created the Fifth Party System.
FDR 's New Deal Coalition united labor unions, big city machines, white ethnics, African Americans और rural white Southerners.
He also influenced the later creation of the United Nations and bretton Woods.
Roosevelt is consistently rated by विद्वानों as one of the top three U.S. Presidents, along with Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.
A liberal Democrat, Roosevelt पारिभाषित his ideological position as `` a little left of center. ''
A Joint कमेटी is a term in politics that is used to refer to a committee made up of members of both कक्षों of a bicameral legislature.
In other contexts, it refers to a committee with सदस्यों from more than one organization.
The regulation of वेश्यावृति in the United States is not among the enumerated powers of the federal सरकारी ; Under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is therefore exclusively the domain of the states to परमिट, prohibit, or otherwise regulate commercial sex, except insofar as कॉंग्रेस may regulate it as part of interstate commerce with laws like the Mann Act.
In most states, prostitution is considered a misdemeanor in the category of public order crime, a crime that disrupts the order of a जातियाँ.
It was at one time considered to be a vagrancy crime.
फिलहाल, Nevada is the तभी state to allow brothel prostitution, the terms of जिससे are stipulated in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
Only 8 counties currently contain active brothels.
All forms of prostitution are illegal in Clark County ( which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area ), Washoe County ( which contains रेनो ), Carson City, Douglas County, and Lincoln County.
The other counties theoretically allow brothel prostitution, but some of ये counties currently have no active brothels.
Street prostitution, `` pandering, '' and living off of the proceeds of a prostitute remain illegal under नेवाडा law, as elsewhere in the country.
As with other countries, prostitution in the United States can be divided into three broad categories : street वेश्यावृति, brothel prostitution, and escort prostitution.

Stratocumulus stratiformis cumulogenitus
In meteorology, a बादल is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body.
These suspended particles are also known as aerosols.
Clouds in Earth 's atmosphere are studied in the बादल physics branch of meteorology.
दो processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated ; cooling the air or adding water वाष्प to the air.
In general, वर्षण will पतन to the surface ; an exception is virga, which evaporates पहले reaching the surface.
The international cloud classification system is based on the फैक्ट clouds in their most basic फ़ॉर्म can show free-convective upward growth like cumulus, appear in non-convective layered sheets such as stratus, or take the form of thin fibrous wisps, as in the case of cirrus.
prefixes are प्रयुक्त in connection with clouds to express variations or complexities in these basic फ़ॉर्म or to specify middle or high altitude ranges.
These include strato- for low clouds with limited convection that form mostly in uneven layers, cumulo- for complex highly-convective तूफ़ान clouds, nimbo- for thick layered clouds of some complexity that can produce moderate to heavy precipitation, alto- for middle clouds, and cirro- for high clouds ; the latter दो of which may be of simple or moderately complex structure.
Whether or not a cloud is low, middle, or high level depends on how far above the ground इसके base forms.
Cloud प्रकार with significant vertical extent can form in the low or middle altitude ranges depending on the moisture content of the air.
बादल in the troposphere have Latin names due to the popular adaptation of Luke Howard 's cloud categorization system, which began to spread in popularity दौरान December 1802.
Synoptic surface weather observations use code numbers to record and report the types of tropospheric cloud visible at each scheduled observation time based on the height and physical appearance of the clouds.
While a majority of clouds form in Earth 's क्षोभमण्डल, there are occasions when बादल in the stratosphere and mesosphere can be observed.
These three main layers of the atmosphere where clouds may be seen are collectively known as the homosphere.
Above this lies the thermosphere and exosphere, which together मेक up the heterosphere that marks the transition to बाहरी space.
Clouds have been observed on other ग्रह and moons within the Solar System, but, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are composed of other substances such as methane, ammonia, और sulfuric acid.

The Big Ten Conference, formerly Western Conference and Big Nine Conference, is the oldest Division I college athletic conference in the United States.
इसके बारह member institutions ( which are primarily फ्लैगशिप research universities in their संबंधित states, well-regarded academically, and with relatively large student enrollment ) are located primarily in the Midwest, stretching from Nebraska in the वेस्ट to penn State in the east.
The conference competes in the NCAA 's Division I ; its फ़ुटबॉल टीमों compete in the फ़ुटबॉल Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport.
Member schools of the Big Ten ( or, in two cases, उनके parent university systems ) also are members of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, a leading educational and research consortium.
Despite the conference 's name, the Big Ten actually consists of 12 स्कूलों, following the जोड of The Pennsylvania State University in 1993 and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 2011.
In 2014, the conference होगा expand to 14 members with the additions of the University of Maryland, College पार्क and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.

सिंगल Malt Scotch is सिंगल malt whisky made in Scotland using a pot still आसवन process at a single distillery, with malted barley as the only grain ingredient.
As साथ any Scotch whisky, a single malt Scotch must be distilled in Scotland and matured in oak casks in Scotland for at least three years ( most single malts are matured longer ).
`` Malt '' indicates कि the whisky is distilled from a `` malted '' grain.
Several types of grains can be malted ( लिये example, barley, rye and wheat हैं all grains which can be malted ) ; however, in the case of single malt Scotch, barley is always the only grain used.
`` Single '' indicates that all the malts in the bottle come from a single distillery.
bottlings containing malt whisky from multiple distilleries are called `` blended malt ``.
Until the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 ( SWR 2009 ), the word `` blended '' only appeared ( in the context of Scotch whisky ) on bottles of whisky that contained a mixture of both barley and non-barley grain whisky, लकिन this is no longer the case.
Under the terminology established by the SWR 2009, a `` blended malt Scotch whisky '' is a mixture of single malt Scotch whiskies, नहीं a mixture of malted barley whisky and non-barley whisky ; those हैं called `` blended Scotch whisky '', without the word `` malt ''.
The term `` blended malt '' replaced `` vatted malt '' used under the prior labelling conventions.
The age statement on a बोतल of single malt Scotch is the number of सालो the whisky spent maturing in cask.
As very few whiskies are bottled from a सिंगल cask the age statement reflects the age of the youngest malt in the मिक्सर.
A बनावट may be arranged so as to, `` closely approach the single-object status of fused-ensemble timbres, लिये example, the beautiful 'northern lights ' chord..., in a very interesting distribution of pitches, produces a fused sound supported by a suspended cymbal roll `` ( Erickson ( 1975 ), p.166 & 168 ).
in कंट्रास्ट to अधिक traditional musical बनावट, sound mass composition `` minimizes the importance of individual pitches in preference for texture, timbre, and dynamics as primary shapers of gesture and impact. ''
Developed from the modernist tone clusters and spread to orchestral writing by the late 1950s and 1960s, sound-mass `` obscures the boundary between sound and noise `` ( Edwards 2001, pp. 326–27 ).
Techniques which may create or be used with sound mass include extended techniques such as muted brass or strings, flutter tonguing, wide vibrato, extreme ranges, and glissandos.
composers and works include Barbara Kolb, Pauline Oliveros ' Sound Patterns for chorus ( 1961 ), Norma Beecroft 's From Dreams of Brass for chorus ( 1963–1964 ), and Nancy Van de Vate.
Beecroft `` blurs individual pitches in favor of a collective timbre through the use of vocal and instrumental clusters, choral speech, narrator, and a wash of sounds from an electronic टेप. ''
( ibid )
a very early उदाहरण is the opening of Jean-Féry Rebel 's ballet Les Elémens ( 1737–38 ), where chaos is represented by a gradually cumulating orchestral cluster of all seven notes of the D minor scale ( Henck 2004, pp. 52–54 ).
A later example is the third movement of Ruth Crawford Seeger 's String Quartet 1931 ( nonesuch h-71280 ) while more recently Phill Niblock 's multiple drone based music serves as an example.
The use of `` मदारी approaching timbres '' begins with Debussy and Edgard Varèse often carefully scored individual instrumental parts so that they would fuse into one ensemble timbre or sound mass ( Erickson 1975, pp. 18 and 21 ).
Other examples include European `` textural '' compositions of the fifties and sixties ऐसे as Krzysztof Penderecki 's Threnody to the पीड़ितों of हिरोशिमा ( 1959 ) and György Ligeti 's works featuring micropolyphony in works like Atmosphères ( 1961 ) and his Requiem ( 1963-65 ).
Other composers with works using this technique include Henryk Górecki, Karel Husa, Witold Lutosławski, Kazimierz Serocki, and Steven Stucky.
Sound mass techniques भी appear in the music of George Crumb ( Anon. n.d. ).

the महाद्वीप of Australia lies on a continental shelf overlain by shallow seas which divide it into several landmasses — the Arafura Sea and Torres Strait between mainland Australia and New Guinea, and Bass Strait between mainland ऑस्ट्रेलिया and Tasmania.
When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice age, including the last glacial maximum about 18,000 BC, they were कनेक्ट by dry land.
During the past ten thousand सालो, rising sea levels overflowed the lowlands और separated the महाद्वीप into today 's low-lying arid to semi-arid mainland and the two mountainous islands of New Guinea और Tasmania.
Geologically, a continent extends to the edge of इसके continental shelf, so the now-separate islands are माना part of the continent.
Due to the spread of animals, fungi and plants across the single pleistocene landmass the separate lands have a related biota.

The lake is deep at its deepest point, which makes it the deepest lake in the United States, the second deepest in North America और the ninth deepest in the world.
Crater Lake is often referred to as the seventh deepest lake in the world, but this former listing excludes the approximately depth of subglacial Lake Vostok in Antarctica, which resides under nearly of ice, and the recent report of a maximum depth for Lake O'Higgins /San Martin, located on the border of Chile and Argentina.
however, जब comparing its औसत depth of to the average depth of other deep lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the तीसरा deepest in the world.

The Chronomégaphone, designed for large halls, employed compressed air to amplify the अंकित sound.
A sound film is a motion picture with synchronized sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, as opposed to a silent film.
the first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades would pass पहले ध्वनि motion pictures were made commercially practical.
Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve साथ the जल्दी sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were भी inadequate.
Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923.
The primary steps in the commercialization of sound cinema were taken in the mid- to late 1920s.
At first, the sound films incorporating synchronized dialogue—known as `` talking pictures '', or `` talkies '' —were exclusively shorts ; the earliest feature-length movies साथ recorded ध्वनि included only music and effects.
The first feature film originally प्रस्तुत as a talkie was the Jazz Singer, released in October 1927.
A major hit, it was made with Vitaphone, the leading brand of sound-on-disc technology.
Sound-on-film, however, would soon become the standard for talking pictures.
By the early 1930s, the talkies यहूद a global phenomenon.

EMOs कार्य with school districts or charter स्कूलों, using public funds to finance operations.
The बहुमत of for-profit schools in the k–12 sector in America function as EMOs, and have grown in number in the mid-2000s.
The other major category of for-profit schools are post-secondary institutions which operate as businesses, receiving fees from each student they enroll.
A third type of for-profit schools, जिससे is less prevalent in the United States, are K–12 schools which operate as businesses.
EMOs function differently from charter schools created in order to carry out a particular teaching pedagogy ; most charter schools are mission-oriented, while EMOs and other for-profit institutions are market-oriented.
जबकि supporters argue that the profit motive encourages efficiency, this arrangement has also drawn controversy and criticism.
Kevin Carey, director of the education policy कार्यक्रम of the New American Foundation कहा in a 2010 column in The वृत्तान्त of Higher Education that `` For-profits exist in large part to fix educational market failures left by traditional institutions, and they profit by serving students that public and private nonprofit institutions too often ignore. ''
He भी noted that `` There 's no doubt that the worst for-profits are ruthlessly exploiting the commodified college degree.
But they did n't commodify it in the first place. ''

A पकड़ें dredge
Dredging is an excavation activity or operation usually carried out at least partly underwater, in shallow seas or fresh water areas with the purpose of gathering up bottom sediments and disposing of them at a different location.
This technique is often used to keep waterways navigable.
It is also used as a रास्ता to replenish sand on some public beaches, where sand has been lost because of तटीय erosion.
Dredging is also used as a तकनीक for fishing for certain species of edible clams and crabs, see fishing dredge.
A dredger ( or “dredge” as is the general उपयोग in the Americas ) is any device, machine, or vessel that is used to excavate and remove material from the bottom of a body of water.
For example, a scoop attached to the end of a rope or pole by which a man can draw sediments up इससे the bottom of a pond is a dredger.
Developing this idea further, a motorized crane equipped with a drag bucket or clamshell ( grabber ) that is used to scoop material from the bottom of a body of water is also a dredger.
The crane could be located on the bank, or perhaps mounted on a barge.
If the crane is mounted on a barge, the entire vessel is referred to as a dredger.
The process of dredging creates spoils ( excess material ), which are carried away from the dredged area.
Dredging can produce materials for land reclamation or other purposes ( प्रायः construction-related ), and रै also historically played a significant role in gold mining.
Dredging can create disturbance in aquatic ecosystems, often with adverse impacts.
Cleveland Volcano in the Aleutian आइलैंड्स of Alaska photographed from the International Space Station, May 2006.
Ash plumes reached a height of 19 km दौरान the climactic eruption at Mount Pinatubo, Philippines in 1991.
A volcano is an opening, or rupture, in a ग्रह 's surface or crust, which allows hot magma, volcanic ash and gases to एस्केप from the magma कक्ष below the surface.
Volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging.
A mid-oceanic ridge, for example the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has examples of volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart ; the Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together.
by contrast, volcanoes are usually not निर्मित where two tectonic plates slide past one another.
Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the Earth 's crust in the interiors of plates, e.g., in the East अफ़्रीकी Rift, the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field और the Rio Grande Rift in North अमेरिका.
This type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of `` थाली hypothesis '' volcanism.
Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes.
These so-called `` hotspots ``, for example Hawaii, are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core–mantle boundary, 3,000 km deep in the Earth.
erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption.
Volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with जेट engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature.
Large eruptions can affect temperature as राख and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth 's lower atmosphere or troposphere ; however, they also अवशोषित heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere.
Historically, so-called volcanic winters have caused अनर्थकारी famines.
Benedict Arnold ( June 14, 1801 ) थी a general during the American Revolutionary War who originally fought for the American Continental Army but defected to the British फौज.
जबकि a general on the American side, he obtained command of the fort at West Point, New York, and planned to surrender it to the अंग्रेजों forces.
After the plan was exposed in September 1780, he was commissioned into the British Army as a brigadier general.

After joining the growing army outside Boston, he distinguished himself through acts of intelligence and bravery.
His actions included the कैप्चर of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, defensive और delaying tactics despite losing the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776, the बैटल of Ridgefield, Connecticut ( after which he was promoted to major general ), operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix, and कुंजी actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777, in which he suffered leg injuries that ended his combat career for several years.
Despite Arnold 's successes, he was passed over for promotion by the Continental Congress while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments.
Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other malfeasance, but most often he was acquitted in formal inquiries.
Congress investigated his accounts and found he was indebted to Congress after spending much of his own money on the war effort.
Frustrated and bitter, Arnold decided to change sides in 1779, and opened secret negotiations with the British.
In July 1780, he was offered, जारी to pursue and was awarded command of West Point.
Arnold 's scheme to आत्मसमर्पण the fort to the British was exposed when American forces captured British Major John André carrying papers कि revealed the plot.
Upon learning of André 's capture, Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the अंग्रेजों sloop-of-war Vulture, narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of George Washington, who had been alerted to the plot.
Arnold received a commission as a brigadier general in the अंग्रेजों Army, an annual pension of £360, and a lump sum of over £6,000.
He led British forces on raids in Virginia, and against New London and Groton, कनेक्टिकट, before the war effectively ended with the American victory at Yorktown.
In the winter of 1782, Arnold moved to London with his second बीवी, Margaret `` पैगी '' Shippen Arnold.
He was well received by King George III and the Tories but frowned upon by the Whigs.
In 1787, he returned to the व्यापारी business with his sons Richard and हेनरी in Saint John, New Brunswick.
He returned to London to settle permanently in 1791, where he died ten years later.
Because of the way he changed पहलू, his name quickly became a in the United States for treason or betrayal.
His conflicting legacy is recalled in the ambiguous nature of some of the memorials that have been placed in his honor.

Plateletpheresis ( more accurately called thrombocytapheresis or thrombapheresis, though ये names हैं rarely used ) is the process of collecting thrombocytes, more commonly called प्लेटलेट्स, a component of blood involved in रक्त clotting.
The term specifically refers to the method of collecting the platelets, which is performed by a यंत्र used in blood दान कि separates the platelets and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.
Platelet transfusion can be a life-saving procedure in preventing or treating गंभीर complications from bleeding and hemorrhage in मरीजों who have disorders manifesting as thrombocytopenia ( low platelet count ) or platelet dysfunction.
This process may also be used therapeutically to treat disorders resulting in extraordinarily high platelet counts such as अनिवार्य thrombocytosis.
In computer networking, a port is an application-specific or process-specific तन्त्र construct serving as a communications endpoint in a computer 's host operating system.
a port is associated with an IP address of the host, as well as the type of प्रोटोकॉल used लिये communication.
The purpose of ports is to uniquely identify different applications or processes running on a single computer and thereby enable them to share a single physical connection to a packet-switched network like the Internet.
The protocols that primarily use पोर्ट are the Transport Layer protocols, ऐसे as the Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) and the User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) of the Internet Protocol Suite.
A port is identified for each address and protocol by a 16-bit number, commonly known as the port number.
The port number, added to a computer 's IP address, completes the गंतव्य address for a communications सत्र.
That is, data packets are routed across the network to a specific destination IP address, और then, upon reaching the destination computer, are further routed to the specific process bound to the destination port number.
Note that it is the combination of IP address and port क्रमांक together that must be globally अद्वितीय.
Thus, different IP addresses or protocols may use the same port number for communication ; e.g., on a given host or interface UDP and TCP may use the वही port number, or on a host with two interfaces, both addresses may be associated with a port having the वही number.
of the thousands of enumerated ports, about 250 well-known ports are reserved by convention to identify specific service types on a host.
In the client-server model of application architecture, ports are used to provide a multiplexing service on each server-side port number that संजाल clients connect to for service initiation, after which communication can be reestablished on other connection-specific port numbers.

of snow गिरी on January 13 alone, setting a new record for snow in one calendar day.
By the end of January 14, of snow had fallen.
The cold weather and snowfall throughout the rest of January and फ़रवरी resulted in frozen ट्रैक्स throughout the Chicago 'L ' system.
commuters crowded onto CTA buses, quickly overwhelming capacity, resulting in usual bus commutes of 30-45 minutes taking up to several hours.
To avoid huge snowdrifts in the streets, the overcrowded buses were obliged to take numerous detours, adding additional time to the commute.
Deployment of plows was significantly delayed and जब they finally appeared वे struggled to keep up साथ the snowfall.
Much of the snow remained unremoved throughout the next 2 महीने, causing ongoing पब्लिक transit देरी and significant problems with trash collection.
The city 's inadequate response to the blizzard was blamed primarily on mayor Michael Bilandic, जो had assumed the post after the 1976 death of Richard J. Daley.
Newspaper articles at the time blasted bilandic ; जेन Byrne, Bilandic 's main political rival in the लोकतांत्रिक primary ( who had previously worked with Bilandic in the Daley administration और been fired by Bilandic when the two could not get साथ ), capitalized on this and went on to defeat Bilandic in the February 27 primary.
The 12-hour clock is a time convention in which the 24 hours of the day are divided into two periods : a.m. ( इससे the Latin ante meridiem, meaning `` before midday '' ) and p.m. ( post meridiem, `` after midday '' ).
Each period consists of 12 hours numbered : 12 ( acting as zero ), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, और 11.
The 12-hour क्लॉक was developed over समय from the mid-second millennium bc to the 16th century AD.
Health spending per capita, in $ US PPP-adjusted, with the US and Canada compared amongst other first world nations.
Comparison of the health care systems in Canada and the संयुक्त States are often made by सरकारी, public health and public policy analysts.
the two countries had similar health care systems पहले Canada reformed its system in the 1960s and 1970s.
The United States spends much more money on health care than Canada, on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP.
In 2006, per-capita spending for health परवाह in Canada was US $ 3,678 ; in the U.S., US $ 6,714.
The U.S. spent 15.3 % of GDP on स्वास्थ्य care in that year ; Canada spent 10.0 %.
In 2006, 70 % of health care spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46 % in the United States.
Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on health care was 23 % higher than Canadian government spending, and U.S. government व्यय on health care was just under 83 % of total Canadian spending ( public and private ) though these statistics do n't take into खाता population differences.
Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in बिता.
a 2007 पुनर्विलोकन of सब अध्ययन comparing health outcomes in Canada और the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that `` health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent. ''
Life expectancy is longer in Canada, and its infant mortality rate is lower than that of the U.S., but there is debate about the underlying कल्याणकारी of these differences.
One commonly cited comparison, the 2000 World Health संगठन 's ratings of `` overall health service performance '', which प्रयुक्त a `` कम्पोजिट माप of achievement in the level of health, the distribution of health, the स्तर of responsiveness and fairness of financial योगदान '', ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations.
This study rated the US `` responsiveness '', or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment, as 1st, compared with 7th लिये Canada.
जबकि the average life expectancy for Canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the US, simply comparing the life expectancy of two groups with अलग racial मेकअप and different obesity rates is likely not an प्रभावी way of determining which healthcare system is superior.
The जो 's study methods were criticized by some analyses.
Although वहीँ is a measure of consensus that life-expectancy and शिशु mortality mark the most reliable ways to compare nation-wide health care, assuming the population makeup is similar, a recent report by the Congressional Research Service carefully summarizes some recent data and notes the `` मुश्किल शोध issues '' facing international comparisons.
tarantulas comprise a group of often hairy and very विशाल arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders, of जिससे approximately 900 species have been identified.
इस article only describes members of Theraphosidae, although some other members of the वही suborder are commonly referred to as `` tarantulas ''.
Most species of tarantulas are not dangerous to humans, and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade.
The ton is a unit of measure.
It रै a long history and has acquired a number of meanings and उपयोग over the सालो.
It is used principally as a unit of weight, and as a unit of volume.
It can भी be प्रयुक्त as a measure of energy, लिये truck वर्गीकरण, or as a colloquial term.
It is derived from the tun, the term applied to a barrel of the largest size.
This could contain a volume between 210 और 256 gallons ( 800 to 1000 L ), which could weigh around 2,000 pounds ( 900 kg ) and occupy some of space.
In the United Kingdom the ton is defined as ( avoirdupois पाउंड ).
From 1965 the uk embarked upon a कार्यक्रम of metrication and gradually introduced metric units, including the tonne ( metric ton ), a non-SI मीट्रिक unit defined as 1000 kg.
The UK Weights और Measures अधिनियम 1985 explicitly excluded from use for trade many units and terms, including the ton and the term `` metric ton '' लिये `` tonne ''
In the United States and formerly Canada a ton is defined to be.
Where confusion is possible, the 2240 lb ton is पुकारा `` long ton `` and the 2000 lb ton `` short ton `` ; the tonne is distinguished by its spelling, but usually pronounced the same as ton, hence the US term `` metric ton ''.
In the UK the final `` e '' of `` tonne '' can also be pronounced ( /ˈtʌnɪ/ ), or `` metric ton '' जब it is necessary to make the distinction.
Where accuracy is required the correct term must be used, but लिये many purposes this is not necessary : the metric and long tons differ by only 1.6 %, and the short ton is within 11 % of both.
The ton is the अधिकतम unit of वज़न referred to in colloquial speech.
The term `` ton '' is also प्रयुक्त to refer to a number of units of volume, ranging from in capacity.
it can also be used as a unit of energy, expressed as an equivalent of coal burnt, TNT detonated, or in refrigeration, ice melted.
In Britain, ton is used in slang in several contexts to mean `` 100 ''.
As a cost or a speed, a ton is widely understood to be £100 or 100 किमी.
The Stanley Cup ( ) is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League ( NHL ) playoff winner after the निष्कर्ष of the Stanley कप फाइनल.
Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge कप, the trophy is named for रब Stanley of preston, then- Governor सामान्य of Canada, who awarded it to Canada 's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the संपूर्ण Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game.
The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC.
In 1915, the two professional बर्फ hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast हॉकी Association ( PCHA ), reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face प्रत्येक other for the Stanley Cup.
बाद a series of league mergers और folds, the Stanley `` Presentation Cup '' was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947.
There are actually three Stanley Cups : the original bowl of the `` Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup '', the authenticated `` Presentation Cup '', and the `` Replica Cup '' at the Hall of कीर्ति.
The NHL has maintained effective control over both the trophy itself and its associated trademarks.
Nevertheless, the NHL does not actually own the trophy, but instead uses it by agreement साथ the two Trustees of the Cup.
The NHL has registered trademarks संबद्ध with the name and likeness of the Stanley Cup, although the league 's right to outright own trademarks associated with a trophy it does not own has been विवादित by some legal experts.
Unlike the trophies awarded by the other three major professional sports लीग of North America, a new Stanley Cup is not बना each year ; winners keep it until a new champion is crowned.
It is unusual among trophies, in that it has the names of all of the winning players, coaches, management, और club staff engraved on its chalice.
Initially, a नई बैंड added each year caused the trophy to grow in size, earning the nickname `` Stovepipe Cup ''.
In 1958 the modern one-piece कप was designed साथ a five-band barrel जिससे could contain 13 winning teams प्रति band.
To avoid the Stanley Cup from growing, when the bottom band is full, the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band added to the bottom.
It has been referred to as The Cup, Lord Stanley 's Cup, The Holy Grail, or facetiously ( chiefly by sportswriters ) as Lord Stanley 's Mug.
The स्टेनली Cup is surrounded by numerous legends और traditions, the oldest of which is the celebratory drinking of champagne out of the cup by the winning team.
The original bowl was made of silver और is 18.5 centimetres ( 7.28 inches ) in ऊँचाई और 29 centimetres ( 11.42 inches ) in diameter.
The current Stanley Cup, topped with a copy of the असली bowl, is made of a silver and nickel मिश्रधातु ; it has a height of 89.54 centimetres ( 35.25 inches ) and weighs 15.5 गामा ( 34.5 lb / 2 st 61⁄2 lb ).
Since the 1914–15 season, the Cup has been won a combined 94 times by 18 क्रियाशील NHL teams and five defunct teams.
Prior to कि, the challenge cup was held by nine different टीमों.
The मॉन्ट्रियल Canadiens have won the Cup a record 24 times and are currently the last canadian-based team in the NHL to win the cup after winning it in 1993.
The Stanley Cup was not awarded in 1919 because of a Spanish flu epidemic, and in 2005, as a consequence of the NHL lockout.
The Pineapple ( Ananas comosus ) is a tropical plant with edible multiple fruit consisting of coalesced berries, and the most economically significant plant in the Bromeliaceae family.
Pineapples may be cultivated from a crown cutting of the fruit, possibly flowering in 20–24 months and fruiting in the following six months.
Pineapple does नहीं ripen significantly post-harvest.
Pineapples हैं consumed fresh, cooked, juiced, and preserved, and are found in a wide array of cuisines.
In addition to consumption, in the फिलीपीन the pineapple 's leaves are प्रयुक्त to produce the textile fiber piña - employed as a component of wall paper and furnishings, amongst other uses.
In कंप्यूटर science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type which represents some finite उपसमुच्चय of the mathematical integers.
Integral data types may be of अलग sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative मान.
Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits.
The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers.
कंप्यूटर hardware nearly always provides a way to represent a processor पंजीकरण or memory address as an integer.
the Gordon Dam in Tasmania is a large hydro facility, with an installed capacity of.
Hydroelectricity is the term referring to विद्युत generated by hydropower ; the production of electrical power through the उपयोग of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water.
It is the most widely used रूप of renewable energy, accounting for 16 percent of global electricity generation – 3,427 terawatt-hours of electricity production in 2010, and is expected to increase about 3.1 % each year for the next 25 years.
Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of वैश्विक hydropower in 2010.
China is the largest hydroelectricity निर्माता, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use.
There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 gw : the Three Gorges Dam in China, itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in Venezuela.
the cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, बनाना it a competitive source of renewable विद्युत.
The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.
हाइड्रो is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing उर्जा demands.
However, damming interrupts the flow of नदियाँ and can harm लोकल ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife.
Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct बर्बाद, and has a considerably lower output level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ( ) than fossil fuel powered energy plants.
Wine boy at a Greek symposium
The history of wine spans हज़ारों of years and is closely intertwined with the history of agriculture, cuisine, civilization and humanity itself.
Archaeological evidence suggests that the earliest known wine production occurred in कया is now the country of Georgia around 7000 BCE, with other notable sites in Greater Iran dated 4500 BCE and Armenia 4100 BCE, respectively.

Within the Jewish diaspora communities all around the globe, the traditional and religious use of kosher wine continued to this day.
Wine, linked in myth to Dionysus / bacchus, was common in ancient Greece और Rome, and many of today 's major wine-producing regions of Western Europe were established साथ Phoenician and, later, Roman plantations.
Winemaking technology improved considerably during the समय of the Roman Empire : many grape varieties and cultivation techniques were known ; the design of the wine press advanced ; and barrels were developed for storing and shipping wine.
Rashi, a medieval French rabbi and called the `` father '' of all commentaries that followed on the Talmud and the Tanakh, earned his living as a vintner.
Following the decline of Rome and its industrial-scale wine production for export, the Christian गिरिजाघर in medieval Europe also became a firm supporter of वाइन, necessary for celebration of the Catholic Mass. Whereas wine was forbidden in medieval Islamic cultures, its use in Christian libation was widely tolerated.
Geber and other मुस्लिम chemists pioneered the distillation of wine for Islamic medicinal and industrial purposes such as perfume.
Wine production gradually increased, with consumption burgeoning from the 15th century onwards.
Wine production बच the devastating phylloxera louse of 1887 और eventually स्प्रेड to numerous regions throughout the world.
जिले of West Bengal
The Indian state of West Bengal borders with Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and the Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam and सिक्किम.
The Himalayas lies in the north of the state and the Bay of Bengal is at the south.
In between them, the river Ganges flows eastwards and its main distributary, the Hooghly नदी, flows south to reach the Bay of Bengal.
The Siliguri Corridor, which connects North-East India with rest of the India, झूठ in the North Bengal region of the state.
Geographically, West Bengal is divided into a variety of regions— Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, Terai and Doors region, North Bengal plains, Rarh region, Western plateau और high lands, coastal मैदान, Sunderbans and the Ganges Delta.
In 1947, जब India gained independence, the राज्य of West Bengal was formed with 14 districts, as per partition plan of the तब Bengal province of British India.
The former princely state Koch Bihar joined as a district in 1950, and the former French enclave Chandannagore joined as part of the Hooghly district in 1954.
The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 led to addition of Purulia district to the state और to enlargement of West Dinajpur district.
Later, larger districts such as West Dinajpur, 24 Parganas and Midnapore were bifurcated.
West बंगाल is now विभाजित into nineteen districts under three divisions.
जिले are administered by District Magistrates, and divisions हैं administered by Divisional Commissioners.
कोलकाता, the capital of the state, constitutes the Kolkata district.
Other districts are further divided into administrative units such as subdivisions and blocks, administered by SDO और BDO, respectively.
the Panchayati Raj has a three-tier structure in the state.
The atomic unit is called a ग्राम Panchayat, which is the Panchayat organization for a collection of villages.
the block-level organizations are called Panchayat Samiti, and the district-level संगठन are named Zilla Parishad.
the Caribbean ( or ; ; ; or more commonly Antilles ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands ( some घिरी by the Caribbean Sea और some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean ), और the surrounding coasts.
The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the उत्तर American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.
situated largely on the Caribbean थाली, the region comprises अधिक than 700 islands, islets, reefs, and cays.
( See the list. )
These islands generally form island arcs that delineate the eastern and northern edges of the Caribbean Sea.
the Caribbean islands, consisting of the Greater Antilles on the north and the Lesser Antilles on the south and east ( including the Leeward Antilles ), are part of the somewhat larger West Indies grouping, which also includes the Lucayan Archipelago ( comprising the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands ) north of the Greater Antilles and Caribbean समुद्र.
in a wider sense, the mainland countries of Belize and Guyana – historically and culturally part of the British West Indies – may be included.
geopolitically, the Caribbean islands are usually regarded as a subregion of उत्तर America and are organized into 30 territories including sovereign states, overseas departments, and dependencies.
इससे January 3, 1958, to May 31, 1962, there was a short-lived country called the Federation of the West Indies composed of ten English-speaking Caribbean territories, all of which were then UK dependencies.
the West Indies cricket team continues to represent many of those nations.

The main slave routes in medieval Africa.
इस article discusses systems, history, और effects of slavery within Africa.
See Arab slave trade, Atlantic slave trade, Maafa, and गुलामी in समकालीन Africa for other discussions.
`` Slave transport in Africa ''.
Europeans usually did not enter the interior regions.
Slavery in Africa has existed throughout the continent for many centuries, और continues in the current day.
Systems of servitude and slavery were common in अनेक parts of the continent, as they were in much of the ancient world.
In most African societies where slavery थी prevalent, the enslaved people यहूद largely treated as indentured servants और not treated as chattel slaves.
When the Arab slave trade and अटलांटिक slave trade began, many of the local स्लेव systems changed and began supplying captives for slave बाज़ार outside of अफ़्रीकी.
गुलामी in historical Africa was practiced in many different forms and some of these do not clearly fit the definitions of slavery elsewhere in the संसार.
Debt slavery, enslavement of war captives, military slavery, and दण्ड slavery यहूद all practiced in various parts of Africa.
Although there had been कुछ trans-saharan trade from the interior of Sub-Saharan Africa to other regions, slavery was a छोटी part of the आर्थिक life of many समाजों in Africa until the introduction of transcontinental slave ट्रेड ( Arab and अटलांटिक ).
स्लेव practices were again transformed with European colonization of Africa and the formal abolition of slavery in the early 1900s.

Earth is the third planet from the सूर्य, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight ग्रह in the Solar System.
It is also the largest of the Solar System 's चार terrestrial planets.
it is sometimes referred to as the world or the Blue Planet.
Earth formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago, and life appeared on its surface within its first billion years.
Earth 's biosphere then significantly altered the atmospheric and other basic physical conditions, which enabled the proliferation of organisms as खूब as the formation of the ozone layer, which together with Earth 's magnetic field blocked harmful सौर radiation, and permitted formerly ocean-confined life to move safely to land.
The physical properties of the Earth, as well as its geological history and orbit, have allowed life to persist.
estimates on how much longer the planet होगा be able to continue to support life दायरा from, to as long as.
Earth 's lithosphere is divided into several rigid segments, or tectonic plates, that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years.
About 71 % of the surface is covered by salt जल oceans, with the remainder consisting of continents and islands which together have many lakes and अन्य sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere.
धरती 's poles are mostly covered साथ ice that is the solid ice of the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice कि is the polar ice पैक.
The planet 's interior remains active, with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the magnetic field, and a मोटा layer of relatively solid mantle.
Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon.
During one orbit around the Sun, the धरती rotates about its own axis 366.26 times, creating 365.26 सौर days, or one sidereal year.
the Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane, producing मौसमी variations on the ग्रह 's surface साथ a period of one tropical year ( 365.24 solar days ).
The Moon is Earth 's तभी natural satellite.
It began orbiting the धरती about.
The Moon 's gravitational interaction with Earth stimulates ocean tides, stabilizes the axial tilt, and gradually slows the planet 's rotation.
The planet is home to लाखो of species of life, including humans.
Both the mineral resources of the planet and the products of the biosphere contribute resources that are used to support a global human population.
These inhabitants हैं grouped into about 200 independent sovereign states, which interact through diplomacy, travel, trade, and military action.
Human cultures have विकसित many views of the planet, including इसके personification as a planetary deity, its shape as flat, its position as the center of the universe, and in the modern Gaia Principle, as a single, self-regulating organism in इसके own right.
the Magician from the Waite-Smith tarot, who is depicted using the same tools that आधुनिक Wiccans use.
In the neopagan religion of Wicca, a range of magical tools are used in ritual practice.
Each of these tools has different uses और associations, and are प्रयुक्त primarily to direct magical energies.
They are used at an वेदी, inside a जादू वृत्त.
In traditional Gardnerian Wicca, the tools are often divided into personal tools, which are for उपयोग by, and owned by, an individual wiccan, और आउटटेक tools, used collectively by the coven.
This अभ्यास may derive partly from Masonic traditions ( such as the use of the Square and Compasses ), from जिससे Wicca draws some material, और partly from the rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.
The latter made much use of material from medieval grimoires such as the Key of Solomon, which has many illustrations of magical tools and instructions for their preparation.
Typical eukaryotic cell.
Cellular respiration is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes कि take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy इससे nutrients into adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ), and तब release waste products.
The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy in the प्रक्रम as weak so-called `` high-energy '' bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products.
श्वसन is one of the key ways a cell gains useful उर्जा to fuel सेल्यूलर activity.
Cellular respiration is माना an exothermic redox reaction.
The overall reaction is broken into many smaller ones when it occurs in the body, most of which are रेडॉक्स reactions themselves.
Although technically, cellular respiration is a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell.
इस difference is because it occurs in many separate steps.
While the overall reaction is a दहन reaction, no single reaction कि comprises it is a combustion reaction.
Nutrients कि are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids और वसीय acids, and a common oxidizing agent ( electron acceptor ) is molecular oxygen ( O2 ).
The energy भंडारित in एटीपी ( its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the अणु and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to रूप, thereby transferring energy for use by the cell ) can then be used to ड्राइव processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes.
A stored-pressure fire extinguisher made by Amerex
A British fire extinguisher with ID sign, call point and fire action sign
A fire extinguisher, flame extinguisher, or simply an extinguisher, is an active fire protection device used to extinguish or control small fires, प्रायः in आपात situations.
It is not intended for use on an out-of-control fire, such as एक which has पहुँचे the ceiling, endangers the user ( i.e., no escape route, smoke, explosion hazard, etc. ), or otherwise requires the expertise of a fire विभाग.
Typically, a fire extinguisher consists of a hand-held cylindrical pressure vessel containing an agent which can be discharged to extinguish a fire.
In the United States, fire extinguishers, in all buildings अन्य than houses, are generally required to be serviced and inspected by a Fire Protection service company at least annually.
Some jurisdictions आवश्यकता more frequent service लिये fire extinguishers.
The servicer places a tag on the extinguisher to indicate the type of service performed ( annual inspection, recharge, new fire extinguisher ) and when.
वहीँ are two main types of fire extinguishers : stored pressure and cartridge-operated.
In stored pressure units, the expellant is stored in the same chamber as the firefighting agent itself.
Depending on the agent used, different propellants are used.
With शुष्क chemical extinguishers, nitrogen is typically used ; water and foam extinguishers typically use air.
Stored pressure fire extinguishers are the most common type.
Cartridge-operated extinguishers contain the expellant gas in a पृथक cartridge that is punctured prior to discharge, exposing the propellant to the extinguishing agent.
This type is not as common, used primarily in क्षेत्रों such as industrial facilities, where they प्राप्त higher-than-average use.
They have the advantage of simple and prompt recharge, allowing an operator to discharge the extinguisher, recharge it, and return to the fire in a उचित amount of time.
Unlike stored pressure प्रकार, these extinguishers use संपीडित carbon dioxide instead of nitrogen, although nitrogen cartridges are used on low temperature ( -60 rated ) मॉडल.
Cartridge operated extinguishers are उपलब्धियाँ in dry chemical and शुष्क powder types in the U.S. and in water, wetting agent, foam, dry chemical ( classes एबीसी and B.C. ), and dry powder ( class D ) types in the rest of the world.
Fire extinguishers are further divided into handheld and cart-mounted, also called wheeled extinguishers.
Handheld extinguishers weigh from 0.5 to 14 kilograms ( 1 to 30 pounds ), and हैं hence, easily portable by hand.
Cart-mounted units typically weigh 23+ kilograms ( 50+ pounds ).
These wheeled models are most commonly found at निर्माण sites, airport runways, heliports, as well as docks and marinas.
Native Americans in the United States are the indigenous peoples in North America within the सीमाएँ of the present-day continental United States, Alaska, and the island state of Hawaii.
They are रचित of numerous, distinct Native American tribes और ethnic groups, many of which survive as बरकरार political communities.
The terms used to refer to Native अमेरिकी have been controversial.
According to a 1995 U.S. Census Census_Bureau Bureau Census_Bureau set of home interviews, most of the respondents with an expressed preference refer to themselves as American Indians ( or simply Indians ), and this term रै been adopted by major newspapers and कुछ academic groups ; however, this term does not typically include Native hawaiians or certain Alaskan Natives, such as Aleut, Yup'ik, or Inuit peoples.
Since the end of the 15th century, the migration of Europeans to the Americas, and their importation of Africans as slaves, has led to centuries of conflict and adjustment between Old and New World societies.
Europeans created most of the early written ऐतिहासिक record about Native Americans after the colonists ' immigration to the Americas.
Many Native Americans lived as hunter-gatherer societies and told their histories by oral traditions.
In many groups, women carried out sophisticated cultivation of numerous varieties of staple फसलों : maize, beans and squash.
The indigenous cultures were quite different from those of the agrarian, proto-industrial, mostly Christian आप्रवासियों from western Eurasia.
Many Native cultures were matrilineal ; the people occupied lands for use of the entire community, for शिकार or कृषि.
europeans at that time had patriarchal cultures and had विकसित concepts of individual property rights with respect to जमीन that were extremely different.
The मतभेद in cultures between the established देशी Americans and immigrant Europeans, as well as shifting alliances among different राष्ट्र of each culture through the centuries, caused extensive political tension, ethnic violence and social disruption.
The Native Americans suffered high fatalities from the contact with infectious यूरेशियाई diseases, to which वे had no acquired immunity.
Epidemics after European contact caused the greatest loss of life for indigenous populations.
Estimates of the pre-Columbian population of what today constitutes the U.S. vary significantly, ranging from 1 million to 18 million.
After the colonies revolted against Great Britain and established the United States of America, President George Washington और Henry Knox conceived of the idea of `` civilizing '' Native Americans in preparation for assimilation as U.S. citizens.
Assimilation ( whether voluntary as with the Choctaw, or forced ) became a consistent policy through American administrations.
During the 19th century, the ideology of manifest destiny became integral to the American nationalist movement.
Expansion of european-american populations to the west after the American Revolution resulted in increasing pressure on Native अमरीकी lands, warfare between the समूह, and rising tensions.
In 1830, the u.S. Congress passed the भारतीय Removal Act, authorizing the government to relocate Native Americans from उनके homelands within established states to lands west of the Mississippi River, accommodating European-American expansion.
The first European Americans to encounter the पश्चिमी interior tribes were generally fur traders and trappers.
There were also Jesuit missionaries active in the Northern टियर.
As United States expansion reached into the American West, settler and miner migrants came into increasing conflict with the Great Basin, Great Plains, and other Western tribes.
These were complex nomadic संस्कृतियों based on horse culture और seasonal bison hunting.
They carried आउट strong resistance to United States incursions in the decades after the American सिविल War, in a series of Indian Wars, which were frequent up until the 1890s, but जारी into the 20th century.
The transcontinental railroad brought more non-Natives into tribal land in the west.
Over time, the U.S. forced a series of treaties and land cessions by the tribes, and established reservations for उन्हें in many western states.
U.S. agents encouraged Native अमेरिकी to adopt European-style farming and similar pursuits, but European-American agricultural technology of the time was inadequate for often dry reservation lands.
In 1924, Native Americans who were not already U.S. citizens were granted citizenship by Congress.
Contemporary Native Americans have a unique relationship with the United States because they may be members of nations, tribes, or bands with sovereignty and treaty rights.
Central अमेरिका ( ) is the central geographic region of the Americas.
It is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with दक्षिण America on the southeast.
When माना part of the unified continental model, it is considered a subcontinent.
Central America consists of seven countries : Belize, Costa Rica, El साल्वाडोर, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.
Central America is part of the mesoamerican biodiversity हॉटस्पॉट, which extends from northern Guatemala through central Panama.
It is bordered by Mexico to the north, the Caribbean Sea to the east, the North Pacific Ocean to the west, and Colombia to the south-east.
Central America is an area of, or almost 0.1 % of the धरती 's surface.

A भाप engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using भाप as its working fluid.
Using boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back about 2,000 years, but early devices were not practical.
Since the late 1700s steam engines have become a major source of mechanical power.
The first अनुप्रयोग were removing जल इससे mines.
in 1781 James Watt patented a भाप इंजन that produced continuous rotative motion.
These 10 hp engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered.
The engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood ईंधन could be obtained.
By 1883, engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible.
Steam engines could also be applied to vehicles such as traction इंजन and the railway locomotives which are commonly just called steam engines outside America.
the stationary steam इंजन was a key component of the Industrial Revolution, allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable.
आज steam turbines generate about 90 % of the इलेक्ट्रिक power in the United States using a किस्में of heat sources.
Steam engines are external combustion engines, जहाँ the working द्रव is separate इससे the combustion products.
Non-combustion heat sources ऐसे as solar power, nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used.
the ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle.
In the साईकिल, water is heated into भाप in a boiler until it reaches a high pressure.
जब expanded through pistons or turbines, mechanical work is done.
The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler.
In general usage, the term steam engine can refer to either the integrated steam plants ( including boilers etc. ) such as रेल steam इंजनों and portable engines, or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone, as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine.
Specialized devices such as steam hammers and भाप pile drivers are dependent on steam supplied from a separate boiler.

Australia has no official state religion and the Australian संविधान protects freedom of religion.
The presence of Christianity in Australia began साथ the arrival of the पहला Fleet of British convicts in 1788.
The religion grew to account for 96.1 % of the national population at the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901.
The Anglican Church of Australia ( formerly known as the Church of England in Australia ) remained the largest denomination until 1986, when it was surpassed by the Roman Catholic Church in Australia.
Post-war multiculturalism और a decline in धार्मिक observance among some sections of the जनसांख्यिकी have diversified the जनसांख्यिकी of religion in ऑस्ट्रेलिया.
Of the roughly 61 % identifying as Christian in 2011, the largest denominations were either रोमन Catholic ( 25 % ) or Anglican ( 17 % ), with the third largest denomination being the 5 % affiliated with the Uniting Church in Australia.
Post-war immigration रै grown the संख्याएँ belonging to churches like the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of ऑस्ट्रेलिया and there are large and growing पेंटेकोस्टल groups, such as Sydney 's Hillsong Church.
The festivals of Easter and Christmas are public holidays in Australia.
Around a quarter of students attend church schools and Christian organisations are leading non-government providers of health and welfare services through organisations like Catholic Health ऑस्ट्रेलिया, Anglicare, unitingcare Australia, the मोक्ष Army and St Vincent de Paul Society.
Historically significant Australian Christians have included Rev Dr John Dunmore लैंग, Saint Mary MacKillop, कैथरीन Helen Spence, Pastor David Unaipon, the Reverend John Flynn and Pastor सर Doug Nicholls.

Founded in 1701 in the उपनिवेश of Connecticut, the university is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States.
Originally chartered as the `` Collegiate School '', the institution traces its roots to 17th-century clergymen who sought to स्थापित a कॉलेज to train clergy and राजनैतिक leaders लिये the colony.
In 1718, the College was renamed `` Yale College '' to honor a तोहफा from Elihu Yale, a governor of the British East India Company.
In 1861, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences became the first u.S. institution to award the PhD. Yale became a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900.
Yale College was transformed, beginning in the 1930s, through the establishment of residential colleges : 12 now मौजूद and two अधिक are planned.
Yale employs over 1,100 faculty to teach and advise about 5,300 undergraduate and 6,100 graduate and पेशेवर students.
Almost all tenured professors teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of जिससे are offered annually.
The विश्वविद्यालयों 's एसेट include an endowment valued at $ 19.4 billion, the second-largest of any अकादमिक संस्था in the world.
Yale 's system of more than two dozen पुस्तकालयों holds 12.5 million volumes.
49 Nobel Laureates have been affiliated with the University as students, faculty, and staff.
Yale has produced many notable alumni, including five U.S. Presidents, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, and several foreign heads of राज्य.
At the graduate level, Yale Law स्कूल, Yale School of Art, and Yale School of Drama हैं consistently ranked the top programs in their फ़ील्ड.
Yale Law School is the most selective law school in the संयुक्त States.
yale students compete intercollegiately as the yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League.
The oldest intercollegiate athletic event in the United States is the Yale-Harvard regatta.
Artemisia tridentata ( `` big sagebrush '' or `` sagebrush '' ) is an aromatic shrub from the family Asteraceae, which grows in arid and semi-arid conditions, throughout a range of cold desert, steppe, and mountain habitats in the Intermountain West of North America.
The देशी नाम `` sagebrush '' is also used for several related members of the genus Artemisia, such as कैलिफ़ोर्निया Sagebrush ( Artemisia californica ).
Big Sagebrush and other artemisia species are the dominant plants across large portions of the Great Basin, covering some 422,000 square miles in 11 पश्चिमी U.S. & Canadian states.
It is the state flower of Nevada.
sagebrush provides food और habitat for a variety of species, such as sage grouse, pronghorn antelope, gray vireo, pygmy rabbit, and mule deer.
Big sagebrush was used as an herbal medicine by देशी Americans throughout the Intermountain West of North America—especially for preventing infection in wounds, stopping internal bleeding, and treating headaches and colds.
Chemically, the active medicinal constituents include camphor, terpenoids, और tannins.
Several major threats exist to sage brush ecosystems, including human settlements, conversion to agricultural land, livestock grazing, invasive plant species, wildfires, and जलवायु change.

Tacoma (, ) is a mid-sized urban port city and the county seat of Pierce County, Washington, United States.
The city is on Washington 's Puget Sound, southwest of Seattle, northeast of the state capital, Olympia, and northwest of Mount Rainier National Park.
the population was 198,397, according to the 2010 census.
Tacoma is the second-largest city in the Puget Sound area and the third largest in the state.
Tacoma भी serves as the बीच of business activity for the South Sound region, which has a population of around 1 million people.
टकोमा adopted its name after the nearby Mount Rainier, originally called Mount Tahoma.
It is known as the `` City of Destiny '' because the क्षेत्रफल was chosen to be the western terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad in the late 19th century.
the निर्णय of the railroad was influenced by Tacoma 's neighboring deep-water harbor, शुरुआत Bay.
By connecting the bay with the railroad Tacoma 's motto became `` जब rails meet sails. ''
Today Commencement Bay serves the Port of टकोमा, a center of international trade on the Pacific Coast and Washington state 's largest बंदरगाहों.
जैसे most central cities, Tacoma suffered a prolonged decline in the mid-20th century as a result of suburbanization and divestment.
Since the 1990s, developments in the downtown core include the University of Washington Tacoma ; Tacoma Link, the first modern electric light rail service in the state ; the state 's highest density of art and history museums ; और a restored urban waterfront, the Thea Foss Waterway.
With a long history of blue-collar labor politics — from the railroad workers of the 19th century, to the longshoremen of the 20th century, to the Labor Ready workers of आज — Tacoma रै long been known for its rough, किरकिरी image.
A सोंग about Tacoma, `` Thrice All American '', by American singer-songwriter and former resident Neko Case, describes it as `` a dusty old jewel in the South Puget Sound / where the factories निकले / and the timber 's all cut down ''.
Tacoma-Pierce County has been named one of the most livable areas in the country.
टकोमा was also recently listed as the 19th most walkable city in the country.
In contrast, the city is also ranked as the most stressed-out city in the country in a 2004 survey.
In 2006, women 's magazine Self named Tacoma the `` Most Sexually Healthy City '' in the United States.
In 2012, The Advocate gave Tacoma the title of `` Gayest City in America '', in part because of the large diversity of पब्लिक कार्यालयों held, and Washington State passing a bill in 2012 allowing LGBT couples to marry.
Tacoma is famous for the 1940 collapse of the Tacoma narrows सेतु.
Chula विस्टा ( ; ) is the second largest city in the San Diego metropolitan क्षेत्रफल, the seventh largest city in Southern California, the fourteenth largest city in the राज्य of California, and the 77th-largest city in the United States.
The population was 243,916 as of the 2010 census.
Located just from downtown San Diego and from the Mexican border in the South Bay region of the metropolitan area, the city is at the center of one of the richest economic and culturally diverse zones in the United States.
Chula Vista is so named because of its scenic location between the सैन Diego Bay and coastal mountain foothills.
Founded in the early 19th century, fast population growth has recently been observed in the city.
As the second largest नगर in San Diego County, Chula Vista has quickly become a destination popular to many tourists.
स्तिथ in the city is one of America 's few year-round United States Olympic Training centers and popular tourist destinations include Cricket Wireless Amphitheater, the Chula विस्टा marina, and the Chula Vista Nature बीच.
Metes और bounds is a system or method of describing land, real property ( in contrast to निजी property ) or real estate.
The system has been used in इंग्लैण्ड for many centuries, and is still used there in the definition of general boundaries.
By custom, it was applied in the original Thirteen Colonies that became the United States, and in many अन्य land jurisdictions based on English आम law.
Typically the system uses physical features of the local भूगोल, साथ with directions and distances, to define and describe the सीमाएँ of a parcel of land.
The boundaries are described in a running prose style, working around the parcel in sequence, from a point of beginning, returning back to the same point ; compare साथ the मौखिक ritual of beating the bounds.
It may include references to other adjoining parcels ( and their owners ), and it, in turn, could also be referred to in later surveys.
At the time the description is compiled, it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where वहीँ were no suitable natural monuments.
The term `` metes '' refers to a boundary defined by the measurement of each straight run, specified by a अलहदा between the terminal points, and an अभिविन्यास or direction.
A direction may be a simple compass bearing, or a precise orientation determined by accurate सर्वेक्षण methods.
The term `` bounds '' refers to a more general boundary description, such as along a certain watercourse, a stone wall, an adjoining public road रास्ता, or an existing building.
The system is often used to define larger pieces of property ( e.g. farms ), और political subdivisions ( e.g. town boundaries ) where precise definition is not required or would be far too expensive, or previously designated boundaries can be incorporated into the description.
Sir Isaac Newton ( 25 December 164220 March 1727 ) was an English physicist and mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a कुंजी figure in the scientific revolution.
His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( `` Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy '' ), first published in 1687, laid the foundations for most of classical mechanics.
Newton also made seminal contributions to optics and shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the invention of the infinitesimal calculus.
Newton 's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists ' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries.
It also demonstrated that the motion of वस्तुएँ on the Earth and that of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles.
By deriving Kepler 's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, Newton removed the last doubts about the वैध of the heliocentric model of the ब्रह्मांड.
Newton built the first व्यावहारिक reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colours of the visible spectrum.
He भी formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound.
In addition to his work on the calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the पढ़ाई of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, and developed Newton 's method for approximating the roots of a function.
न्यूटन was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of कैम्ब्रिज.
He was a devout but unorthodox Christian and, unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty, he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England, perhaps because he privately rejected the doctrine of trinitarianism.
In जोड to उसके work on the mathematical sciences, Newton also dedicated much of his समय to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death.
In his बाद life, Newton became president of the Royal Society.
He also served the British government as Warden and Master of the Royal Mint.
Prof. Walter lewin explains Newton 's law of gravitation in MIT course 8.01
Satellites and projectiles all obey Newton 's law of gravitation
Newton 's law of universal gravitation states that every point mass in the universe attracts प्रत्येक other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
( Separately it was shown that large spherically symmetrical masses attract and are attracted as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers. )
This is a general physical law derived from अनुभवजन्य observations by what Newton called induction.
It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton 's work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( `` the Principia '' ), first published on 5 July 1687.
( When Newton 's book was presented in 1686 to the Royal समाज, रॉबर्ट Hooke made a अर्जी कि Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him – see History section below. )
In modern भाषा, the law states the following:
Assuming si units, F is measured in newtons ( n ), m1 and m2 in kilograms ( kg ), r in meters ( m ), and the constant g is approximately equal to.
The value of the constant G थी first accurately determined from the results of the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798, although Cavendish did not himself गणना a numerical मान for G.
This experiment was also the first test of Newton 's theory of gravitation between masses in the laboratory.
it took प्लेस 111 years after the publication of Newton 's प्रिन्सिपिया and 71 years after Newton 's death, so none of Newton 's calculations could use the value of G ; instead he could only calculate a force relative to another force.
Newton 's law of gravitation resembles Coulomb 's law of विद्युत forces, which is used to calculate the magnitude of electrical force between दो charged bodies.
Both are inverse-square laws, in which force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies.
Coulomb 's Law has the product of two charges in place of the product of the masses, and the electrostatic constant in प्लेस of the gravitational constant.
Newton 's law has since महरूम superseded by Einstein 's theory of general relativity, but it continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the प्रभाव of gravity.
Relativity is जरूरी only when there is a need for extreme precision, or when dealing with gravitation for extremely massive and dense objects.
White and red flags, representing Iraqi and अमरीकी deaths, बैठना in the grass quadrangle of The Valley Library on the Corvallis, Oregon, कैम्पस of Oregon State University.
As part of the traveling Iraq Body Count exhibit from 2008 to 2009 ( not related to इराकी Body Count project ), the flags aim to `` raise awareness of the human cost of the Iraq War. ''
( May 2008 )
Casualties of the विरोध in Iraq since 2003 ( beginning with the 2003 invasion of इराकी, and continuing with the ensuing occupation of Iraq, as well as the क्रियाएँ of the various armed groups ऑपरेटिंग in the country ) have come in many फ़ॉर्म, and the accuracy of the information available on different types of Iraq War casualties varies greatly.
The table below summarizes various estimates of the इराकी casualty figures.
For troops in the U.S.-led multinational coalition, the death toll is carefully tracked और updated daily, and the names and photographs of those killed in action as well as in दुर्घटनाओं have महरूम published widely.
A total of 4,486 U.S. soldiers were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2012.
Regarding the Iraqis, however, information on दोनो military and civilian casualties is दोनो less precise and less consistent.
Estimates of casualty levels are available from reporters on the scene, from officials of शामिल organizations, and from groups that summarize information on incidents reported in the news media.
The शब्द `` casualties `` in its most general sense शामिल the injured as well as the dead.
Accounts of the number of गठबन्धन wounded vary widely, partly because it is not स्पष्ट what should be counted : should only those injuries serious enough to put a soldier out of commission be included ?
Do बीमारियों or injuries caused by accidents count, or should the फ़ोकस be restricted to wounds caused by hostile engagement ?
Sources using different definitions may arrive at very different numbers, and sometimes the precise definition is not clearly specified.
Asalto al coche ( Robbery of the कोच ), by Francisco de Goya
A highwayman was a thief and brigand who preyed on travellers.

Allium cells in different phases of the cell cycle
The cells of eukaryotes ( left ) and prokaryotes ( right )
The cell is the basic structural, functional and biological unit of all known living organisms.
It is the smallest unit of life that is classified as a living thing ( except virus, which consists only from DNA/RNA covered by protein and lipids ), and is often called the भवन block of life.
It consists of a protoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.
Organisms can be classified as unicellular ( consisting of a single cell ; including सबसे bacteria ) or multicellular ( including plants and पशु ).
While the number of cells in plants and animals varies इससे species to species, Humans contain about 100 trillion ( 1014 ) cells.
Most plant and animal cells are between 1 and 100 micrometres and therefore are visible only under the microscope.
The cell was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665.
The cell theory, first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden और theodor Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, कि सब cells आइये from preexisting cells, that vital functions of an organism occur भीतर cells, and that all cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions और लिये transmitting information to the अगला generation of cells.
Cells emerged on planet Earth at least 4.0–4.3 billion years ago.
The word cell comes from the Latin cella, meaning `` small room ''.
The descriptive term for the smallest living biological structure was coined by रॉबर्ट Hooke in a book he published in 1665 जब he compared the cork cells he saw through his microscope to the small rooms भिक्षुओं जिया in.

A motor scooter 's front with an impractical number and variety of headlamps, added for decorative उद्देश्य
A headlamp is a lamp attached to the front of a vehicle to light the सड़क ahead.
Headlamp performance has steadily improved throughout the automobile age, spurred by the great disparity between daytime and nighttime traffic fatalities : the u.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states that nearly half of all traffic-related fatalities occur in the dark, despite only 25 % of ट्रैफ़िक travelling during darkness.
While it is common for the term headlight to be used interchangeably in informal discussion, headlamp is the term for the यंत्र itself, while headlight properly refers to the beam of light produced and distributed by the device.
Other vehicles, such as trains and aircraft, are जरूरी to have headlamps.
Bicycle headlamps are often used on साइकिल, and are required in some jurisdictions.
They can be powered by a battery or a small electrical generator on the wheel.
Additionally automotive night vision systems कार्य to supplement headlamps.
Women 's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls of many societies worldwide.

Maggots feeding on carrion.
A maggot is the larva of a fly ( order Diptera ) ; it is applied in particular to the larvae of Brachyceran flies, such as houseflies, चीज flies, and blowflies, rather than larvae of the Nematocera, such as mosquitoes and क्रेन flies.
`` Maggot '' is not a technical term and should not be taken as ऐसे ; in many मानक textbooks of entomology it does not appear in the index at all.
In अनेक non-technical texts the term is used for insect larvae in general.
Other sources have coined their अपना definitions ; for example : ``...
The term applies to a grub जब all trace of limbs has disappeared... '' and ``... Applied to the footless larvae of Dipters. ''
Maggot-like fly larvae are of wide importance in पारिस्थितिकी and medicine ; among other roles, various species are prominent in रीसाइक्लिंग carrion and garbage, attacking crops and foodstuffs, spreading microbial infections, and causing myiasis.
Herod (, Hordos, Greek :, Hērōdēs ), also ज्ञात as Herod the Great ( 73/74 BCE – 4 BCE in Jericho ), was a Roman client king of Judea.

He is भी ज्ञात for his colossal building projects in Jerusalem and elsewhere, including his expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem ( sometimes referred to as Herod 's Temple ) and the construction of the port at Caesarea Maritima.
Important details of his biography are gleaned from the works of the 1st century CE Roman–Jewish historian Josephus Flavius.
The Romans made Herod 's son, Herod Archelaus, ethnarch of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea ( biblical Edom ) from 4 BCE to 6 ce, referred to as the tetrarchy of Judea.
archelaus was judged incompetent by the Roman emperor Augustus who then combined Samaria, judea proper and Idumea into Iudaea province under rule of a prefect until आयु 41.

SD technologies have महरूम implemented in more than 400 brands across dozens of उत्पाद categories और more than 8,000 models.
the Secure Digital format includes चार card परिवारों available in three different form factors.
The four families are the original Standard-Capacity ( SDSC ), the High-Capacity ( SDHC ), the eXtended-Capacity ( SDXC ), और the SDIO, जिससे combines input/output कृत्यों with आंकड़ा storage.
The three form factors are the original size, the `` mini '' size, and the `` micro '' size ( देखिए illustration ).
There are many combinations of form factors and device families.
Electrically passive adapters allow the use of a smaller card in a host device built to थाम a larger card.
Host डिवाइस that comply with नए versions of the specification provide backward compatibility and accept पुरानी SD cards, but this article explains several factors that can prevent the use of a newer SD card:
A newer card may offer greater capacity than the host device can handle.
A newer card may use a file system the host device can not navigate.
Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides.
The organization of the card was changed starting with the SDHC family.
Some vendors produced SDSC cards above 1 GB before the SDA had मानकीकृत a method of doing so.
The SDA uses several trademarked logos to enforce compliance with its specifications and assure users of compatibility.

It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han.
It was briefly बाधित by the Xin Dynasty ( 9–23 AD ) of the former regent Wang Mang.
इस interregnum separates the Han into two periods : the Western Han ( 206 BC – 9 ad ) and Eastern Han ( 25–220 AD ).
Spanning over four centuries, the काल of the हान Dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history.
To this day, China 's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the `` Han लोगों '' and the Chinese script is referred to as `` Han characters ``.
The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government, known as commanderies, and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms.
ये kingdoms धीरे lost all vestiges of their independence, विशेषकर following the Rebellion of the Seven States.
The Xiongnu, a nomadic confederation which dominated the eastern Eurasian Steppe, defeated the Han army in battle in 200 BC.
Following the defeat, a political marriage गठबंधन was negotiated in which the Han became the de facto अवर partner.
जब, despite the treaty, the Xiongnu continued to raid Han borders, सम्राट Wu of Han ( r. 141–87 BC ) launched several military campaigns against them.
The ultimate Han विजय in ये wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries.
ये campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as दूर as the Mediterranean world.
Han forces managed to divide the Xiongnu into two competing nations, the Southern and Northern Xiongnu, and forced the उत्तरी Xiongnu across the Ili River.

Tourette 's is no longer considered a rare condition, लकिन it is not always correctly identified क्युकी सबसे cases are mild और the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through किशोरावस्था.
Between 0.4 % and 3.8 % of children ages 5 to 18 may have Tourette 's ; the व्यापकता of transient and chronic tics in school-age children is higher, with the more common tics of eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, सूँघने, and facial movements.
Extreme Tourette 's in adulthood is a rarity, and Tourette 's does not adversely affect प्रज्ञा or life expectancy.
Genetic और environmental factors play a role in the etiology of Tourette 's, but the exact causes are unknown.
In most cases, medication is unnecessary.
There is no effective treatment for every case of tics, but certain medications and therapies can help when their use is warranted.
शिक्षा is an important part of any treatment plan, and explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment.
Comorbid शर्तें ( co-occurring diagnoses other than Tourette 's ) such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and obsessive–compulsive disorder ( OCD ) are present in many patients देखी in tertiary specialty clinics.
These other conditions often कारण more functional impairment to the individual than the tics that are the hallmark of Tourette 's, hence it is important to correctly identify comorbid conditions and treat them.
The eponym was bestowed by jean-martin Charcot ( 1825–1893 ) on निमित्त of उसके निवासी, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette ( 1859–1904 ), a French physician and neurologist, who प्रकाशित an account of nine patients with Tourette 's in 1885.

The international notation has a different numbering system than the previous two, और the right permanent mandibular first molar is known as `` 46 '', and the left one is known as `` 36 ''.
Mandibular primary first molars usually have चार pulp horns.
The first molar is usually the पहला permanent tooth to erupt and has adult undertones.
Anatomy : the mandibular first molar रै पाँच पुलिन : the mesiobuccal ( MB, toward midline and cheek ), mesiolingual ( ML, toward midline and tongue ), distolingual ( DL, away इससे midline and towards tongue ), distobuccal ( DB, away इससे midline and toward cheek ), and distal ( D, away from midline ), listed in order of decreasing आकार.
Listed in order of decreasing ऊँचाई they are : ML, DL, DF, MF, and D. an eighth cusp was found in a primary दूसरी lower molar in an Argentinean child.
Viewed from the top of the tooth ( occlusal view ), the mandibular first molar is pentagonal ( five sided ) in shape and tapers toward the lingual, साथ the sides being the buccal surface, the mesial surface, the lingual surface, distal surface, and the distobuccal सतह.
The occlusal सतह has four grooves.
The central groove is not सीधा but runs down the center of the tooth mesially to distally and contains four pits ( mesial, सेंट्रल, central, and distal ).
The distobuccal groove runs इससे the distal pit in the central groove distobuccally separating the distal and distobuccal cusps.
The lingual groove रनों from the more distal of the central pits in the central groove toward the lingual surface between the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps.
The buccal groove runs from the अधिक mesial of the सेंट्रल pits in the central groove toward the buccal surface between the mesiobuccal और distobuccal cusps ending in the buccal pit.
The portion of the central groove between the central pits is termed the Lewis offset and is mandatory to खाता लिये the locations of the buccal and lingual डोले ( buccal groove being more mesial than the lingual groove जबकि they हैं parallel ).
From the buccal ( buccal view ), two roots are present.
The distal root is generally straighter, although both often have a slight distal curvature.

Honda FCX Clarity, a hydrogen fuel cell demonstration vehicle introduced in 2008
A hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its onboard fuel for motive power.
Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen fueled space rockets, as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles.
The शक्ति plants of such vehicles convert the रासायनिक energy of hydrogen to mechanical उर्जा either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine, or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel कोशिका to run electric motors.
Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed hydrogen economy.
Hydrogen fuel does not occur naturally on Earth and thus is not an energy source ; rather it is an energy carrier.
It is most frequently made इससे methane or other fossil fuels, but it can be उत्पादित using sources ( such as wind, solar, or nuclear ) that हैं intermittent, too diffuse or too cumbersome to directly propel vehicles.
Integrated wind-to-hydrogen पौधे, using electrolysis of water, are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough, and quantities great enough, to compete with traditional उर्जा स्त्रोत.
Many companies are working to develop technologies कि might efficiently exploit the संभावित of hydrogen energy for mobile उपयोग.
The attraction of using hydrogen as an energy currency is that, if hydrogen is prepared without using fossil ईंधन inputs, vehicle propulsion would not contribute to carbon dioxide emissions.
The drawbacks of hydrogen use are high capital cost, low energy content per unit volume, high tankage weights, very high भंडार vessel pressures, the storage, परिवहन and filling of gaseous or liquid हाइड्रोजन in vehicles, the large investment in infrastructure that would be required to fuel vehicles, and the inefficiency of production processes.

A `` Betsy Ross '' flag flying बाहर San Francisco City Hall
The बेट्सी Ross flag is an early design of the flag of the United States, popularly attributed to Betsy रॉस, using the common motifs of alternating red-and-white striped field with five-pointed stars in a blue canton.

According to the traditional account, the original flag was made in जून 1776, when a small committee—including George Washington, Robert Morris and relative जार्ज Ross —visited Betsy और discussed the need for a new American flag.
Betsy accepted the जॉब to manufacture the flag, altering the committee 's design by replacing the six-pointed stars with five-pointed stars.
While the Betsy Ross legend is questionable, the flag design is known to have been in use by 1777 ; Alfred B. Street described it at the surrender of General Burgoyne and समझा the circle of stars to represent समता among the American states.
It is one of the oldest versions of U.S. flags ज्ञात to exist ; जबकि it is not the oldest surviving flag centuries in cloth form, its likeness appears on older physical relics, namely, the contemporary battlefield paintings by John Trumbull and Charles Willson Peale.

LSD is non-addictive, is नहीं known to cause brain damage, and has extremely low toxicity relative to dose.
However, adverse psychiatric reactions ऐसे as anxiety, paranoia, and delusions are possible.
LSD was first synthesized by Albert Hofmann in 1938 from ergotamine, a chemical derived by Arthur stoll from ergot, a grain fungus that typically grows on rye.

Mens rea is Latin for `` guilty mind ''.
in criminal law, it is viewed as one of the necessary elements of some crimes.
The standard common law परीक्षण of criminal liability is usually expressed in the Latin phrase, actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea, which means `` the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty ''.
Thus, in jurisdictions with due process, there जरूर be an actus reus, or `` अपराधी act, '' accompanied by some level of mens rea to constitute the crime with which the defendant is charged ( see the technical requirement of concurrence ).
as a general rule, criminal liability does not attach to a person who acted with the absence of mental fault.
The exception is strict liability crimes.
In सिविल law, it is usually नहीं necessary to prove a subjective mental तत्व to establish देयता for breach of contract or अपकृत्य, for example.
however, if a tort is intentionally वचनबद्ध or a contract is intentionally breached, such intent may increase the scope of liability as well as the माप of damages payable to the plaintiff.
Therefore, mens rea refers to the mental element of the offence that accompanies the actus reus.
In some jurisdictions, the terms mens rea and actus reus have been replaced by alternative terminology.
In Australia, for example, the elements of the federal offences are now designated as `` दोष elements '' or `` mental elements '' ( mens rea ) and `` physical तत्व '' or `` external elements '' ( actus reus ).
This terminology was adopted to replace the obscurity of the Latin terms with simple and accurate phrasing.

Lee surrendered his depleted forces to ग्रान्ट at appomattox as the confederacy collapsed.
Although pro-Confederate historians attacked Grant as a निष्ठुर butcher who won by brute force, most historians have hailed his military genius.

As president, he enforced Reconstruction by enforcing सिविल rights कानून and fighting Ku Klux Klan violence.
ग्रान्ट won passage of the Fifteenth Amendment ; giving constitutional protection for African-American voting rights.

शारीरिक exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights and by robotic spacecraft.
While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of विशाल and relatively efficient rockets during the early 20th सदी that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality.
Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, uniting अलग nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity and developing military और strategic advantages against other countries.
Various criticisms of space exploration are sometimes made.

After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station ( ISS ).
With the substantial completion of the ISS following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the USA remain in flux.

A contract is an agreement having a lawful object entered into voluntarily by two or more parties, each of whom intends to create one or more legal obligations between उन्हें.
The elements of a contract are `` प्रस्ताव '' and `` acceptance '' by `` competent persons '' having legal capacity who exchange `` consideration '' to create `` mutuality of obligation. ''
Proof of कुछ or all of these elements may be done in writing, though contracts may be made entirely orally or by conduct.
The remedy for breach of contract can be `` damages '' in the form of compensation of money or specific प्रदर्शन enforced through an injunction.
Both of these remedies award the party at loss the `` benefit of the bargain '' or expectation damages, which हैं greater than mere reliance damages, as in promissory estoppel.
The parties may be natural persons or juristic persons.
A अनुबंध is a legally enforceable promise or undertaking that something will or will not occur.
The word promise can be used as a legal synonym लिये contract, हालांकि care is required as a promise may not have the full standing of a contract, as when it is an agreement without consideration.
Contract law varies greatly from एक jurisdiction to another, including differences in common law compared to civil law, the impact of received law, particularly from England in common law countries, and of law codified in regional विधान.
Regarding Australian Contract Law for example, there are 40 relevant acts which impact on the interpretation of contract at the Commonwealth ( Federal / national ) level, and an additional 26 acts at the level of the राज्य of NSW.
In addition there are 6 international यंत्र or conventions which are applicable for अंतरराष्ट्रीय dealings, such as the United Nations सम्मेलन on Contracts for the अंतरराष्ट्रीय Sale of Goods.
Sidney Patrick Crosby, ONS ( born August 7, 1987 ) is a Canadian professional ice हॉकी player who is captain of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League ( NHL ).
Crosby was drafted first overall by the Penguins out of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey लीग ( qmjhl ).
During his two-year major junior career with the Rimouski Océanic, he earned back-to-back chl खिलाड़ी of the Year awards and led his club to the 2005 Memorial Cup फाइनल.
nicknamed `` The अगला One ``, he was one of the most highly regarded draft picks in हॉकी history, leading अनेक to refer to the 2005 Draft Lottery as the `` Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes ''.
in his पहला NHL season, Crosby finished sixth in league scoring with 102 points ( 39 goals, 63 assists ) and was a runner-up लिये the Calder Memorial Trophy ( won by Alexander Ovechkin ).
By his second season, he led the NHL with 120 points ( 36 लक्ष्य, 84 assists ) to capture the Art Ross Trophy, becoming the youngest player and the only teenager to win a scoring शीर्षक in any प्रमुख North American sports league.
That same season, Crosby also won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the Professional Hockey Writers Association 's choice for most valuable player and the Lester B. पियर्सन Award as the NHL Players Association 's choice for most outstanding खिलाड़ी, becoming the seventh player in NHL history to earn all three awards in one year.
crosby started the 2007–08 season with the team 's captaincy and subsequently led them to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated by the Detroit Red Wings in six games.
The Penguins returned to the Finals against डेट्रॉयट the following year and won in seven games ; Crosby became the youngest captain in एनएचएल history to win the Stanley Cup.
In the 2009–10 season, Crosby scored a career-high 51 goals, tying him with Steven Stamkos for the Rocket Richard Trophy as the league-leader ; with 58 assists, he totaled 109 points, second in the NHL.
During the off-season, Crosby received the Mark Messier Leadership Award.
In 2010–11, Crosby sustained a concussion as a result of hits to the head in back-to-back games.

A United States cent, also known as a penny.
`` My two cents '' ( 2¢ ) and its longer version `` put my two cents in '' is an संयुक्त States ( US ) idiomatic expression, taken from the original English idiom expression : to put in `` my two pennies worth '' or `` my tuppence worth. ''
It is used to preface the tentative stating of one’s opinion.
By deprecating the opinion to follow – suggesting its value is only two cents, a very small amount – the user of the phrase hopes to lessen the impact of a possibly statement, showing politeness और humility.
However, it is also sometimes used with irony when expressing a strongly felt opinion.
The phrase is also used out of habit to preface uncontentious opinions.
For example:
The Chinese सिविल War was a civil war in China fought between forces loyal to the government of the Republic of China led by the Kuomintang ( KMT ) and forces of the कम्युनिस्ट Party of China ( CPC ).
The war began in April 1927, amidst the उत्तरी Expedition, and essentially ended when major क्रियाशील लड़ाइयों ceased in 1950.
The विरोध eventually resulted in two de facto states, the गणतंत्र of China ( ROC ) in Taiwan and the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) in mainland China, both claiming to be the legitimate government of China.
The war represented an वैचारिक split ( Left vs. Right ) between the Communist CPC, and the KMT 's brand of Nationalism.
The civil war continued intermittently जबतक late 1937, when the two parties formed a दूसरी United Front to counter a Japanese आक्रमण.
China 's full-scale civil war resumed in 1946, a year after the end of hostilities with Japan.
After four more सालो, 1950 saw the cessation of major military hostilities—with the newly founded People 's Republic of China controlling mainland China ( including Hainan ), and the गणतंत्र of China 's jurisdiction being restricted to Taiwan, Penghu, Quemoy, Matsu and several outlying islands.
The Kuomintang defeat is attributed to several कारकों : Corruption - Chiang wrote in his डायरी on June 1948 that the KMT had failed, not because of external enemies but because of दुर्गन्ध from within.
Strong आरंभिक support from the U.S. diminished, and then, stopped.
( Partly because of KMT corruption and anti-democratic regime, and partly because of the uncertain U.S. foreign policy towards Communism between 1945 and 1950 ) ; Communist land reform policy promised poor peasants farmland from their landlords.
This ensured PLA popular support.
After the आत्मसमर्पण of Japan at the end of World War II, Soviet forces turned over उनके captured Japanese weapons to the CPC and allowed the CPC to take control of territory in Manchuria.
To this दिन, no armistice or peace treaty has कभी been signed, and it is debated as to the whether the Civil War has legally ended.
Cross-Strait relations have been hindered by military खतरे and political and economic pressure, particularly over Taiwan 's political status, with both governments officially adhering to a `` One-China policy. ''
The PRC still actively claims Taiwan as part of its territory and continues to threaten the ROC with a military invasion if the ROC officially declares independence by changing its name to and gaining international recognition as the Republic of Taiwan.
The आरओसी mutually claims mainland China, and they both continue the fight over diplomatic recognition.
Today, the war as such occurs on the राजनैतिक and economic fronts in the form of cross-Strait relations ; however, the two separate de facto states have close economic ties.
The One Hundred Twelfth United States Congress was the meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal सरकारी, from January 3, 2011 until January 3, 2013.
It convened in Washington, D.C. on January 3, 2011, and ended on जनवरी 3, 2013, 17 days before the end of the presidential term to which Barack Obama was elected in 2008.
Senators elected to regular terms in 2006 completed those terms in this Congress.
This Congress included the last House of Representatives elected from congressional districts that were apportioned based on the 2000 census.
in the 2010 midterm elections, the Republican Party won the बहुमत in the House of Representatives.
While the Democrats kept उनके Senate majority, it was घटाया from the previous Congress.
This was the first Congress in which the हाउस and Senate were controlled by different parties since the 107th Congress ( 2001–2003 ), और the first Congress to begin कि way since the 99th Congress ( 1985–1987 ).
In this Congress, the House of Representatives had the largest number of Republican members, 242, since the 80th Congress ( 1947–1949 ).
It was also the first Congress since 1947 in which no सदस्य of the Kennedy family served, as well as the most politically polarized कॉंग्रेस since Reconstruction, with record low approval ratings.
Wealth in the United States is commonly measured in terms of net worth, which is the sum of all assets, including home इक्विटी, minus all liabilities.
The total net worth of US households और nonprofit organizations 1945–2009, unadjusted for inflation or population change.
For उदाहरण, a household in possession of an $ 800,000 house, $ 5,000 in mutual funds, $ 30,000 in cars, $ 20,000 worth of stock in their own company, and a $ 45,000 IRA would have assets totaling $ 900,000.
Assuming that this household would have a $ 250,000 mortgage, $ 40,000 in car loans, and $ 10,000 in credit card debt, its debts would total $ 300,000.
Subtracting the debts इससे the worth of this household 's एसेट ( 900,000 - $ 300,000 = $ 600,000 ), this household would have a net लायक of $ 600,000.
Net worth can vary with fluctuations in value of the underlying assets.
The माल —more specifically, the मध्य net worth—of households in the United States is varied with relation to race, education, geographic स्थान and gender.
As one would expect, households with greater income feature the highest net worths, though high आय can not be taken as an always accurate indicator of net worth.
Overall the number of wealthier households is on the rise, with baby boomers hitting the highs of their करियर.
In addition, माल is unevenly distributed, with the wealthiest 25 % of US households owning 87 % of the wealth in the संयुक्त States, which थी $ 54.2 खरब in 2009.
Including human capital such as skills, the United Nations estimated the total wealth of the संयुक्त States in 2008 to be $ 118 trillion.
This article deals with Selective Dorsal rhizotomy ( SDR ) rather than the rhizotomy procedures for pain relief ; for those procedures, which have begun to take the name `` rhizotomy '' in certain instances, see facet rhizotomy and similar.
A rhizotomy ( ) is a term chiefly referring to a neurosurgical procedure that selectively destroys समस्यापूर्ण nerve roots in the spinal cord, most often to relieve the symptoms of neuromuscular शर्तें such as spastic diplegia and other forms of spastic cerebral palsy.
The selective dorsal rhizotomy ( sdr ) लिये spastic cerebral palsy has been the main use of rhizotomy for neurosurgeons specialising in spastic CP since the 1980s ; in this surgery, the spasticity-causing nerves हैं isolated and then targeted and destroyed.
The sensory nerve roots, जहाँ spasticity is located, are पहला separated from the motor ones, and the nerve fibres to be cut are then identified via electromyographic stimulation.
The ones producing spasticity are then selectively lesioned साथ tiny electrical pulses.
In spasticity, rhizotomy precisely targets and destroys the damaged nerves that don’t प्राप्त gamma amino butyric acid, which is the core problem for people with spastic दिमागी palsy.
These over-firing, non-GABA-absorbing nerves generate unusual विद्युत activity during the emg testing phase in SDR and are thus considered to be the source of the patient 's hypertonia ; they are eliminated with the electrical pulses once identified, while the remaining nerves and nerve routes carrying the correct messages remain fully intact and untouched.
This means that the spasticity is permanently dissolved, and that this is done without affecting nervous system sensitivity or function in other areas, because the only nerves destroyed are the over-firing ones जिम्मेदार for the muscle tightness.
The terms rhizotomy and neurotomy हैं भी increasingly becoming interchangeable in the treatment of chronic back pain from degenerative disc disease.
This is a procedure called a facet rhizotomy and is not a surgical procedure but is instead done on an outpatient basis using a simple probe to apply radiofrequency waves to the impinged pain-causing तंत्रिका root lying between the facet joint and the vertebral body.
Such radio आवृत्ति nerve lesioning results in five to eight or more months of pain relief before the nerve regenerates and another round of the procedure needs to be performed.
A facet rhizotomy is बस one of अनेक different forms of radiofrequency ablation, और its use of the `` rhizotomy '' name should not be confused with the SDR procedure.

U.S. Route 75 is a north–south u.S. Highway.
The highway 's northern terminus is in kittson County, Minnesota, at the Canadian border, where it once continued as Manitoba Highway 75 on the other side of the now-closed border crossing.
Its southern terminus is at Interstate 30 and अंतरराज्यीय 45 in डलास, Texas, where it is known as North Central Expressway.
U.S. 75 was a border-to-border route, from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico at Galveston, Texas.
However, the संपूर्ण खण्ड south of Dallas, टेक्सास has been decommissioned in favor of अंतरराज्यीय 45, a cutoff section of town-to-town surface road having become State Highway 75.
Lower Ninth Ward is a neighborhood of the city of नई Orleans.
As the name implies, it is part of the Ninth Ward of New Orleans.
The Lower नवीं Ward is often thought of as the entire area within New Orleans downriver of the Industrial कनाल ; however, the City Planning Commission divides this area into the Lower Ninth Ward ( 2 ) and Holy Cross ( 3 ) neighborhoods.
The पद `` Lower '' refers to its location farther towards the mouth of the Mississippi River, `` down '' or `` नीचे '' the बाकी of the city in local geographic terminology.
But the 9th Ward, like all Wards in New Orleans, is a voting district.
The 9th Ward was added as a voting district in 1852.
The `` lower '' 9th Ward is composed of Ward 9 Districts 1, 2, 4, and 7 which make up the Holy Cross Area and Ward 9 Districts 3, 5, 6, and 8.
Higher voting district numbers in the 9th Ward ( 8-27 ) are on the upriver side of the Industrial Canal.
The area came to national attention for its devastation in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Red and orange tinted Moon, as seen from Earth during a lunar eclipse, where the Earth comes between the Moon and Sun
The Moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth, and the fifth largest satellite in the सौर प्रणाली.
It is the largest natural satellite of a planet in the Solar प्रणाली relative to the size of its primary, having 27 % the diameter and 60 % the density of Earth, resulting in its mass.
The Moon is the दूसरी densest satellite after Io, a satellite of Jupiter.
The Moon is in synchronous rotation with धरती, always showing the same face with its near पक्ष marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters.
It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun, हालांकि its surface is actually very dark, with a reflectance similar to that of coal.
Its prominence in the sky and its नियमित cycle of phases have, since ancient times, made the Moon an important cultural influence on language, calendars, art and mythology.
The चंद्रमा 's gravitational influence produces the समंदर tides और the मिनट lengthening of the day.
The Moon 's current orbital distance, परिचय thirty times the diameter of the Earth, causes it to appear almost the same size in the आसमान as the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipses.
This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence.
The Moon 's linear अलहदा from the Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3.82±0.07cm per year, but this rate is not constant.
The Moon is thought to have formed nearly 4.5 billion years ago, not long after the Earth.
Although there have been several hypotheses लिये its origin in the past, the current सबसे widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the मलबा left over after a giant प्रभाव between Earth and a Mars -sized body.
The Moon is the तभी celestial body other than Earth on which इंसानो have set foot.
the Soviet Union 's Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959 ; the United States ' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date, beginning with the पहला manned lunar orbiting मिशन by Apollo 8 in 1968, and six manned चंद्र landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first होने Apollo 11.
These missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks, which have been प्रयुक्त to develop a geological understanding of the चंद्रमा 's origins, the formation of its internal structure, and its subsequent history.
After the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft, notably by the final सोवियत Lunokhod rover.
Since 2004, Japan, China, India, the संयुक्त States, and the European Space Agency have each भेजा lunar orbiters.
These spacecraft have contributed to confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith.
Future manned मिशन to the चंद्रमा have been planned, including government as well as privately funded efforts.
The Moon remains, under the Outer Space Treaty, free to all राष्ट्र to explore for शांतिपूर्ण purposes.

Originally a member of the Democratic Party, his positions began shifting rightward in the 1950s, और he switched to the Republican Party in 1962.
After delivering a rousing speech in support of Barry Goldwater 's अध्यक्षीय candidacy in 1964, he was persuaded to seek the California governorship, winning two years later and again in 1970.
He was defeated in his चलाएं for the रिपब्लिकन presidential nomination in 1968 and in 1976, but won both the nomination and general election in 1980, defeating incumbent Jimmy Carter.
As president, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives.
His supply-side economic policies, dubbed `` Reaganomics ``, advocated reducing tax rates to spur economic growth, controlling the money supply to reduce महंगाई, deregulation of the economy, and reducing government बिता.
In his पहला term he survived an assassination attempt, took a hard लकीर against मजदूर unions, announced a new War on Drugs, and ordered an invasion of Grenada.
He was re-elected in a landslide in 1984, proclaiming that it was `` morning in America ``.
His दूसरी term was primarily marked by foreign matters, such as the ending of the Cold War, the 1986 bombing of Libya, and the revelation of the Iran-Contra affair.
Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an `` evil empire ``, he supported anti-communist movements worldwide and spent his first term forgoing the strategy of détente by ordering a massive military buildup in an arms race with the ussr.
Reagan negotiated with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail गोर्बाचेव, culminating in the INF Treaty and the घटी of both countries ' नाभिकीय arsenals.
Reagan left office in 1989.
In 1994, the पूर्व president disclosed that he had been diagnosed साथ Alzheimer 's disease earlier in the year ; he died ten years later at the age of 93.
A conservative icon, he ranks highly in public राय polls of U.S. Presidents and is credited for generating an ideological renaissance on the American political right.

Assassination attempts and plots on राष्ट्रपतियों of the संयुक्त States have been numerous : more than 20 attempts to मार sitting और former presidents, as well as the Presidents-elect, are known.
Four sitting presidents have been मारे : Abraham Lincoln ( the 16th President ), James A. Garfield ( the 20th President ), William McKinley ( the 25th President ) and John F. Kennedy ( the 35th President ).
Two presidents were injured in attempted assassinations : former President Theodore Roosevelt ( the 26th President ), and President Ronald Reagan ( the 40th President ).
Although the historian J.W. क्लार्क has suggested that most American assassinations were politically motivated actions, carried out by rational मेन, not all such attacks have been undertaken for political reasons.
Some attackers had questionable mental stability, और a few were judged legally insane.
Since the Vice President of the United States has for more than a century been elected from the same political party as the President, the assassination of the President is unlikely to result in major policy changes.
This may explain why political groups typically do not make such attacks.

Oklahoma ( ) ( Pawnee : Uukuhuúwa, Cayuga : Gahnawiyoˀgeh ) is a state located in वेस्ट South Central United States.
Oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 United States.
The state 's name is निकला from the Choctaw words okla and humma, अर्थ `` red people '', and it is ज्ञात informally by its nickname, The Sooner State.
Formed by the combination of Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory on November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was the 46th state to enter the union.
Its residents are known as Oklahomans or, informally `` okies '', and इसके capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.
A major producer of natural gas, oil, and agriculture, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology.
It has one of the fastest growing economies in the nation, ranking among the top states in per capita income growth and gross domestic product growth.
Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma 's primary आर्थिक anchors, with nearly two thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan सांख्यिकीय areas.
With small mountain ranges, prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains and the U.S. आंतरिक Highlands —a region especially prone to severe weather.
In addition to having a prevalence of English, German, Scottish, Irish and Native American ancestry, more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma, second तभी to California.

Natural Gas is usually measured by volume in the United States and is stated in cubic feet.
A cubic foot of gas is the amount of गैस needed to fill a volume of one cubic foot under set conditions of pressure and temperature.To measure larger amounts of natural gas, a `` therm '' is used to denote 100 cubic feet, and `` mcf '' is used to denote 1,000 cubic feet.
to provide greater सटीकता in comparing fuels, energy content is measured in terms of `` British Thermal Units ( BTU 's ). ''
a BTU is the amount of heat जरूरी to उठाएँ one pound of water ( approximately a pint ), one degree Fahrenheit at or close to इसके point of maximum density.
एक British therm ( symbol thm ) is a non- SI unit of heat energy equal to 100,000 British thermal units ( btu ).
It is approximately the energy equivalent of burning 100 घन feet ( often referred to as 1 CCF ) of प्राकृतिक gas.
Since ( Natural Gas ) meters measure volume and not energy content, a therm factor is used by ( प्राकृतिक ) gas companies to convert the volume of gas used to इसके heat equivalent, और thus calculate the actual energy use.
The therm factor is usually in the units therms/CCF.
It will vary with the mix of hydrocarbons in the natural gas.
Natural gas with a higher than average concentration of इथेन, propane or butane will have a higher therm factor.
Impurities, such as कार्बन dioxide or nitrogen, lower the therm factor.
The volume of the gas is गणना as if measured at standard temperature and pressure ( STP ).
the heat content of natural gas is solely dependent on the composition of the gas, and is independent of temperature and दबाव.
One therm is equal to about 105.5 megajoules, 25,200 kilocalories or 29.3 kilowatt-hours.
एक therm can भी be provided by about of natural gas.
the therm sometimes has been confused with the thermie ( see below ).
The names of both units come from the Greek word for heat.
A thermie ( th ) is a metric unit of heat energy, part of the meter-tonne-second system sometimes used by European engineers.
the thermie is equal to the राशि of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 tonne of water by 1 °C.
The thermie is equivalent to 1,000 kilocalories, 4.1868 megajoules or 3968.3 BTU.
The American Civil War ( ACW ), also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War ( see नामकरण ), was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States ( the `` Union '' or the `` North '' ) and several Southern slave राज्य that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America ( the `` Confederacy '' or the `` South '' ).
The war had its origin in the issue of slavery, especially the एक्सटेंशन of slavery into the पश्चिमी territories.
Foreign powers did not intervene.
After four सालो of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South 's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity और guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began.
In the 1860 presidential चुनाव, Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, opposed expanding slavery into United राज्य ' territories.
lincoln won, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy.
Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal.
Lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war.
Eight remaining slave states continued to अस्वीकृत calls for secession.
Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy.
A Peace सम्मेलन failed to find a compromise, और both sides prepared for युद्ध.
The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on `` King Cotton `` that they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.
Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon Fort sumter, a key fort held by Union troops in South कैरोलिना.
Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently, four more slave states joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to eleven.
The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy.
The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62.
The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland ( a Union state ) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam, dissuading British intervention.
Lincoln issued the emancipation Proclamation, which made ending slavery a war goal.
To the west, by गर्मियाँ 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in दो at the Mississippi नदी.
In 1863, रॉबर्ट E. Lee 's confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg.
Western successes led to ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864.
In the Western Theater, William T. शरमन drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea, destroying confederate infrastructure along the way.
The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond, the Confederate capital.
The defending confederate army failed, leading to Lee 's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on अप्रैल 9, 1865.
The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial युद्धों.
Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons यहूद employed extensively.
The mobilization of civilian factories, खानों, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies सब foreshadowed World War I.
It remains the deadliest war in American history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties.
Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40.

escherichia coli ( ; commonly abbreviated E. coli ) is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms ( endotherms ).
Most E. coli strains are harmless, लकिन some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in humans, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination.
The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, और can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2, and by preventing the establishment of pathogenic bacteria within the intestine.
E. coli and related जीवाणु constitute about 0.1 % of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission is the major रूट through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease.
Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, जिससे makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples लिये fecal contamination.
There is, however, a growing body of research that has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside of the host.
The bacterium can also be grown easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years.
E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology, where it has परोसा as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA.
Area कोड 217 is the North American telephone area कोड for much of western and central Illinois.
The 217 area शामिल Illinois ' capital, Springfield, plus Champaign, Urbana, Decatur, danville, Quincy, और Rantoul.
217 was एक of the original area codes, which were created in 1947.
The only significant change in 217 's boundaries was in 1957, when its northern portion was combined with part of क्षेत्रफल code 815 to form area code 309.
Image of the largest Antarctic ozone hole ever recorded ( September 2006 ), over the Southern pole
Layers of the माहौल ( not to scale )
Ozone depletion describes two distinct but related phenomena observed since the late 1970s : a steady decline of about 4 % प्रति decade in the total volume of ozone in Earth 's stratosphere ( the ozone layer ), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone over Earth 's polar regions.
The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole.
In addition to these well-known stratospheric phenomena, there are also springtime ध्रुवीय tropospheric ozone depletion events.
The details of polar ozone hole गठन differ from that of mid-latitude thinning, लकिन the most important process in both is catalytic destruction of ozone by atomic halogens.
The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is photodissociation of man-made halocarbon refrigerants ( CFCs, freons, halons ).
These compounds हैं transported into the stratosphere बाद being emitted at the surface.
Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halo-carbons increased.
CFCs and other contributory substances are referred to as ozone-depleting substances ( ODS ).
Since the ozone layer prevents most नुकसानदेह UVB wavelengths ( 280–315 nm ) of पराबैंगनी light ( UV light ) from गुजर through the Earth 's atmosphere, observed and projected decreases in ozone have generated worldwide concern leading to adoption of the Montreal Protocol that bans the उत्पादन of CFCs, halons, and other ozone-depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethane.
It is suspected that a variety of biological consequences such as increases in skin cancer, cataracts, damage to plants, and reduction of plankton populations in the ocean 's photic zone may result from the increased UV exposure due to ozone depletion.
The Preamble to the United States Constitution is a brief introductory statement of the Constitution 's fundamental purposes and guiding principles.
It states in general terms, और न्यायालयों have referred to it as reliable evidence of, the Founding Fathers ' इरादों regarding the Constitution 's meaning and कया they hoped the Constitution would achieve as it pertains to all of the people of the United States.
As the phrase, `` we the लोगों '' suggests that the नई government originates इससे the लोगों of the United States and it sets into motion a question as it pertains to that vast जनसांख्यिकी concerning the individual rights and equality among all people ; this can be seen most broadly in the divide between republicanism and social democracy.

The shot put ( pronounced ) is a track and field event involving `` throwing '' / '' putting '' ( throwing in a pushing गति ) a heavy spherical object —the shot—as far as possible.
The shot put competition लिये men has been a part of the modern Olympics since उनके पुनरुद्धार in 1896, women 's competition began in 1948.
Map of the United Nations ( UN ) member states, with their territories ( including dependent territories ) recognized by the UN in blue
There are United राष्ट्र ( UN ) member states, and each of them is a member of the United Nations General Assembly.
The criteria for admission of new members are set out in the United Nations Charter, Chapter II, Article 4:
A recommendation for admission from the Security Council requires affirmative votes from at least nine of the council 's fifteen members, with none of the five permanent members voting against.
The Security Council 's recommendation must then be subsequently approved in the General Assembly by a two-thirds majority vote.
In principle, तभी sovereign states can become UN members, and currently all UN members are sovereign राज्य ( although a few members were not sovereign when they joined the UN ).
Because a state can only be admitted to the un by the approval of the Security Council and the General Assembly, a number of states that may be considered sovereign states according to the Montevideo Convention criteria हैं not members because the UN does not consider them to possess sovereignty, mainly due to the lack of international recognition or opposition इससे certain members.
In addition to the member states, the UN also invites non-member states ( currently two : the Holy See and फिलिस्तीन ), intergovernmental organizations, and other international organizations और entities whose statehood or sovereignty are नहीं precisely defined, to become observers at the General सभा, allowing them to participate and speak, but not vote, in General Assembly meetings.
The Eiffel Tower (, ) is an iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris, named after the इंजीनियर Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
Erected in 1889 as the प्रवेश arch to the 1889 World 's Fair, it has become both a global cultural प्रतीक of France and one of the सबसे recognizable structures in the world.
The tower is the tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world ; 7.1 million people ascended it in 2011.
The third level observatory 's upper platform is at the highest accessible to public in the European Union and the उच्चतम in यूरोपीय as long as the platform of the Ostankino Tower, at, remains closed as a result of the fire of August 2000.
The tower received इसके 250 millionth visitor in 2010.
The tower stands tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building.
During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930.
क्युकी of the addition, in 1957, of the एंटीना atop the Eiffel Tower, it is अभी taller than the क्रिसलर भवन.
Not including broadcast antennas, it is the second-tallest ढांचा in France, after the Millau Viaduct.

Tickets can be खरीदा to ascend, by stairs or lift ( elevator ), to the first और second levels.
The walk from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the चलना from the first to the second level.
The third and highest level is accessible only by lift—stairs do exist but are usually closed to the public.
The first and second levels have रेस्तरां.
The tower रै become the most prominent प्रतीक of both Paris and फ़्रांस, often in the establishing shot of films set in the city.
Kenneth Wayne `` Ken '' Jennings III ( born May 23, 1974 ) is an American game दिखाएँ contestant and author.
Jennings is noted for holding the रिकार्ड for the longest winning streak on the U.S. syndicated खेल show Jeopardy !
and as being the all-time leading money winner on American game shows.
In 2004, Jennings won 74 Jeopardy !
games before he was defeated by challenger Nancy Zerg on his 75th appearance.
उसके total earnings on Jeopardy !
are $ 3,172,700, consisting of $ 2,520,700 over his 74 विन्स, a $ 2,000 second-place prize in his 75th appearance, a $ 500,000 second-place prize in the Jeopardy !
परम Tournament of champions, as well as half of a $ 300,000 prize in the IBM Challenge.
During his first run of jeopardy !
appearances, जेनिंग्स earned the record for the highest American game show winnings.
His total was surpassed by ब्रैड Rutter, who defeated Jennings in the finals of the Jeopardy !
Ultimate Tournament of Champions ( first aired on May 25, 2005 ), adding $ 2,000,000 to Rutter 's existing jeopardy !
winnings.
Jennings regained the record after appearing on several अन्य game shows, culminating in an appearance on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader ?
( first aired on October 10, 2008 ), though Rutter retains the Jeopardy !
record.
After his success on Jeopardy !, Jennings wrote about his experience and explored American trivia history and culture in his book Brainiac : adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs, published in 2006.
The Canadian Football League or CFL ( ' [ LCF ] in French ) is a professional sports league located in Canada.
The CFL is the highest level of competition in Canadian football, a form of gridiron फ़ुटबॉल closely related to American football.
Its eight current teams, जिससे are located in eight पृथक cities, are विभाजित into two divisions of four teams each — the East Division and the West Division.
The league 's 19-week regular season runs from late June to early November ; each team plays 18 games with one bye week.
Following the regular season, the तीन teams with the best records in their division ( except if the fourth place team in एक division has a better record than the third place team in the other प्रभाग, when the team with the better record makes the playoffs and `` crosses over '' to the other division 's playoff ) compete in the league 's three-week डिवीजनल playoffs, which culminate in the late-November Grey कप championship, the country 's largest annual sports and television event.
the cfl was officially founded on January 19, 1958, making it the second oldest gridiron football league in North America स्टिल in operation, although all its teams long predate the modern formation of the league.
it is the highest level of play in Canadian फ़ुटबॉल, the most popular फ़ुटबॉल league in Canada, and the second-most popular major sports league in Canada, after the National Hockey League.
Although ice hockey is Canada 's most popular sport, the CFL has increased the popularity of Canadian football in Quebec और Western कनाडा.
Canadian football is also played at amateur levels ( i.e. youth, high school, CJFL, QJFL, CIS and senior leagues such as the अलबर्टा Football League ).
The 2010s will be a significant decade लिये the CFL in terms of growth, as teams have renovated, विस्तारित स्टेडियम, or plan to build entirely new stadiums.
The Montreal Alouettes accomplished this first, adding 5,000 seats to Percival Molson Memorial Stadium in समय for the 2010 CFL season.
The Edmonton Eskimos and Calgary Stampeders also renovated their respective स्टेडियम and facilities for the 2010 season.
In 2011, the BC शेर played अंतर्गत a new, retractable roof in BC Place after spending one and a half seasons at साम्राज्य Field.
Then the Winnipeg ब्लू Bombers will play in an entirely new stadium at the University of Manitoba, अनुसूचित to open in time for the 2013 season.
The Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Saskatchewan roughriders and the new Ottawa franchise हैं also looking at new or extensively-renovated stadiums in the following years.
वहीँ are also उम्मीदें of expanding the league to Atlantic Canada ( ideally basing a टोली in either the more populated Halifax, or the more centralized Moncton ), as 2010 and 2011 had regular season games hosted in Moncton.
According to sports historian डगलस Brei, the Canadian Football League holds the distinction of होने the only professional sports league in North America, major or minor league, in which each मौजूदा franchise has won at least one league title while in their current location.
Each antibody binds to a विशिष्ट antigen ; an interaction similar to a lock and key.
An antibody ( Ab ), also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ), is a large Y-shaped protein produced by b-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses.
The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, called an antigen.
Each tip of the `` Y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( a structure analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly analogous to a key ) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision.
Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected कोशिका for आक्रमण by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly ( for example, by blocking a भाग of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and अस्तित्व ).
The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system.
Antibodies are secreted by a प्रकार of white blood cell called a प्लाज्मा cell.
Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell, and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface of a b कोशिका and is referred to as the B कोशिका receptor ( BCR ).
The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and उनके subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells, or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure.
In most cases, interaction of the B कोशिका with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding.
Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey लिये invading microorganisms.
Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily ; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin हैं often used interchangeably.
Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains.
There are several different प्रकार of एंटीबॉडी heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess.
Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different roles, and help सीधा the appropriate immune response लिये each different type of foreign object they encounter.
Though the general structure of all antibodies is बहुत समान, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist.
This region is known as the hypervariable region.
Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen.
This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens.
The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of जीन segments that encode different antigen binding sites ( or paratopes ), followed by random mutations in इस area of the एंटीबॉडी gene, which create further diversity.
Antibody जीनों also re-organize in a process पुकारा class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific परिवर्तनीय region.
This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system.
The symbol used by the Zodiac Killer to sign his correspondence
The Zodiac Killer was a सीरियल killer who operated in Northern California in the लेट 1960s and जल्दी 1970s.
The killer 's identity remains unknown.
The Zodiac murdered victims in Benicia, Vallejo, Lake Berryessa, and सैन Francisco between December 1968 and October 1969.
Four men and three महिलाओं between the आयु of 16 and 29 were targeted.
The killer originated the name `` Zodiac '' in a series of taunting letters भेजा to the लोकल खाड़ी Area press.
These letters included four cryptograms ( or ciphers ).
Of the four cryptograms sent, only one has been definitively solved.
Suspects have been named by law enforcement and amateur जांचकर्ताओं, but no conclusive evidence has surfaced.
In April 2004, the San Francisco Police Department चिह्नित the case `` inactive '', yet re-opened the case at some point prior to March 2007.
The case also remains open in the city of Vallejo, as well as in Napa County and Solano County.
The California विभाग of Justice has maintained an open case संचिका on the zodiac murders since 1969.

Nanotechnology ( sometimes shortened to `` nanotech '' ) is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale.
the earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms और molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology.
A more generalized वर्णन of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the हेरफेर of matter with at least one आयाम sized from 1 to 100 nanometers.
इस definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical प्रभाव are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a शोध category inclusive of all types of शोध and technologies that सौदे with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold.
It is therefore common to see the plural रूप `` nanotechnologies '' as well as `` nanoscale technologies '' to refer to the broad range of research और applications whose आम trait is size.
Because of the variety of potential अनुप्रयोग ( including industrial and military ), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology शोध.
Through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars.
The European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars.
Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad, including fields of विज्ञान as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, microfabrication, etc.
The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from एक्सटेंशन of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials साथ dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale.
Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology.
Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials और devices with a vast range of applications, such as in आयुर्विज्ञान, electronics, biomaterials and energy production.
On the other हाथ, nanotechnology उठाता many of the same issues as any नई technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios.
These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.
Map of the Eastern Bloc
The term Eastern Bloc or कम्युनिस्ट Bloc refers to the former communist states of Central and Eastern यूरोपीय, generally the Soviet संघ and the countries of the Warsaw Pact.
the terms Communist Bloc and Soviet Bloc were also used to denote groupings of states aligned with the Soviet Union, although these terms might include states outside Central and Eastern Europe.
The New Jersey gubernatorial election of 2009 took place on November 3, 2009.
Democratic Governor Jon Corzine was running for a second term and was being challenged by Republican क्रिस Christie, Independent Christopher daggett and नौ others, in addition to several write-in candidates.
Christie won the election, with about 48.5 percent of the vote, to 44.9 percent लिये Corzine and 5.8 percent for daggett.
Christie won the largest margin for a first term रिपब्लिकन since 1969.
क्रिस्टी assumed office on January 19, 2010.
This was the first election to fill the newly created office of Lieutenant Governor.
The candidates for governor and lieutenant governor were joined together as a single choice, so that voters did not have the अवसर to split the ticket.
Kim Guadagno, Christie 's running mate, became New Jersey 's first lieutenant governor following her inauguration.
Health care in the United States is provided by many distinct organizations.
Health care facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses.
Health बीमे for public sector कर्मचारी is primarily provided by the government.
60-65 % of healthcare प्रावधान and spending comes from programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, the Children 's Health Insurance Program, and the Veterans Health Administration.
सबसे of the population under 65 is insured by their or a family member 's employer, some buy health insurance on their own, and the remainder are uninsured.
Of 17 high-income countries studied by the National Institutes of Health in 2013, the United States was at or near the bottom in infant mortality, heart and lung disease, sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancies, injuries, homicides, और दरों of disability.
Together, such issues place the u.S. at the bottom of the list for life प्रत्याशा.
On average, a U.S. male can be expected to live almost four fewer years than those in the top-ranked country.
According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), the United States spent more on health care per capita ( $ 7,146 ), and more on health care as percentage of its GDP ( 15.2 % ), than any other nation in 2008.
The Commonwealth निधि ranked the United States last in the quality of health परवाह among similar countries, and टीप U.S. care costs the most.
the U.S. Census Bureau reported कि 49.9 million residents, 16.3 % of the population, यहूद uninsured in 2010 ( up from 49.0 million residents, 16.1 % of the population, in 2009 ).
A 2004 Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) report said : `` The United States is among the few industrialized nations in the world that does not guarantee access to health care लिये its population. ''
A 2004 OECD report said : `` With the exception of Mexico, Turkey, and the United States, all OECD countries had achieved universal or near-universal ( at least 98.4 % insured ) coverage of their populations by 1990. ''
A 2010 report observed that lack of health बीमे causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States.
In 2007, 62.1 % of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses.
A 2013 study found that about 25 % of all senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses, and 43 % are forced to mortgage or sell their प्राथमिक residence.
On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection और Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) became law, providing लिये major परिवर्तन in health insurance.
in physiology, body water is the water content of the human body.
A significant fraction of the human देह is water.
Arthur Guyton 's textbook of Medical physiology states that `` the total amount of water in a man of average weight ( 70 kilograms ) is approximately 40 litres, averaging 57 percent of his total body weight.
In a newborn infant, this may be as high as 75 percent of the देह weight, but it progressively decreases from birth to बूढ़ा age, most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life.
Also, obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body, sometimes to as कम as 45 percent ''.
These figures are statistical averages, so are illustrative, and like all biostatistics, will vary with things like type of population, age and number of people sampled, and methodology.
So there is not, and can not be, a figure that is exactly the same for all people, for this or any other physiological measure.
For example, Jackson 's ( 1985 ) Anatomy & Physiology for Nurses gives a figure of 60 % for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water, which approximates Guyton 's 57 %.
In diseased states where body water is प्रभावित, the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem.
Body water is regulated by hormones, including anti-diuretic hormone ( ADH ), aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide.
Per Netter 's Atlas of Human Physiology, body water is broken down into the following compartments:
intracellular fluid ( 2/3 of देह water ).
Per Guyton, in a body containing 40 litres of fluid, परिचय 25 litres is intracellular, which amounts to 62.5 % ( 5/8 ), close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb.
Jackson 's texts states 70 % of body fluid is intracellular.
Extracellular fluid ( 1/3 of body water ).
Per Guyton 's illustration, for a 40 litre body, about 15 litres is extracellular, which amounts to 37.5 % Again, this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here.
Plasma ( 1/5 of extracellular fluid ).
Per Guyton 's illustration, of the 15 litres of extracellular fluid, plasma volume averages 3 litres.
This amounts to 20 %, the same as per Netter 's Atlas.
अंतरालीय fluid ( 4/5 of extracellular fluid )
Transcellular fluid ( a.k.a. `` तीसरा space, '' normally ignored in calculations )
contained inside organs, such as the gastrointestinal, cerebrospinal, peritoneal, and ocular fluids.
Self-esteem is a term used in psychology to reflect a person 's overall emotional मूल्यांकन of his or her own worth.
It is a judgement of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self.
Self-esteem encompasses beliefs ( लिये example, `` I am competent, '' `` I am worthy '' ) and emotions such as triumph, despair, pride और शर्म.
Smith and Mackie define it by saying `` The self-concept is what we think about the स्वः ; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel परिचय it. ''
Self-esteem is भी known as the evaluative dimension of the self that includes feelings of worthiness, prides and discouragement.
One 's self-esteem is also closely associated with self-consciousness.
Self-esteem is a disposition that a person has which represents their judgements of their own worthiness.
In the mid-1960s, Morris Rosenberg and social-learning theorists defined self-esteem as a personal worth or worthiness.
nathaniel Branden in 1969 defined self-esteem as `` the experience of being competent to cope with the basic challenges of life and being worthy of happiness. ''
according to Branden, self-esteem is the sum of self-confidence ( a feeling of personal क्षमता ) and self-respect ( a feeling of personal worth ).
It exists as a consequence of the implicit निर्णय that every person has of their क्षमता to face life 's challenges, to समझे and solve problems, and their right to achieve happiness, and be दिए आदर.
As a social मनोवैज्ञानिक construct, self-esteem is attractive because researchers have conceptualized it as an influential predictor of relevant outcomes, such as academic achievement ( Marsh 1990 ) or exercise behavior ( hagger et al. 1998 ).
In addition, self-esteem has भी been treated as an important outcome due to its close relation साथ psychological well-being ( Marsh 1989 ).
Self-esteem can apply specifically to a particular dimension ( for example, `` I believe I am a good लेखक and I feel happy about that '' ) or a global extent ( for example, `` I believe I am a bad person, and महसूस bad about myself in general '' ).
Psychologists प्रायः regard self-esteem as an enduring personality characteristic ( `` trait '' self-esteem ), though सामान्य, short-term variations ( `` state '' self-esteem ) also exist.
Synonyms or near-synonyms of self-esteem include : self-worth, self-regard, self-respect, and self-integrity.
A Masonic Lodge, often termed a Private Lodge or Constituent Lodge, is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry.
Every new Lodge must be warranted or चार्टर्ड by a Grand Lodge, but is subject to its दिशा only in enforcing the published Constitution of the jurisdiction.
By exception the three surviving lodges that formed the संसार 's पहला known Grand Lodge in London ( today called the United Grand Lodge of England ) have the unique privilege to operate as time immemorial i.e. without such warrant ; only one other lodge operates without a warrant - this is the Grand Stewards ' Lodge in London, although it is not भी entitled to the `` time immemorial '' शीर्षक.
A Freemason is generally entitled to visit any Lodge, in any jurisdiction ( i.e. under any Grand Lodge ) in amity with his own.
In some jurisdictions this privilege is restricted to Master Masons ( that is, Freemasons who have attained the Order 's third degree ).
He is first usually required to check, and certify, the regularity of the relationship of the Lodge - and be able to satisfy that Lodge of उसके regularity of membership.
Freemasons gather together as a Lodge to work the three basic Degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft and Master मेसन.
Pilkington Group Limited is a multinational glass manufacturing company headquartered in St Helens, United Kingdom and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Japan-based NSG Group.
Prior to its acquisition by NSG in 2006 it was an independent company listed on the London Stock Exchange and for a time was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
a quotation is the repetition of one expression as part of another one, particularly when the quoted expression is well-known or explicitly attributed by citation to its original source, and it is indicated by ( punctuated with ) quotation marks.
A quotation can also refer to the दोहराया use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works : elements of a painting, scenes from a movie or sections from a musical composition.

Black pepper ( Piper nigrum ) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit, which is usually सूखी and used as a spice and seasoning.
The फल, known as a peppercorn when dried, is approximately in व्यास, dark red when fully mature, and, like all drupes, contains a single seed.
Peppercorns, and the ground pepper derived from them, may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely as ब्लैक pepper ( cooked and dried unripe fruit ), green pepper ( dried unripe fruit ) and white pepper ( dried ripe seeds ).
Black pepper is native to south India, and is extensively cultivated there and elsewhere in tropical regions.
Currently Vietnam is the world 's largest producer and निर्यातक of pepper, producing 34 % of the world 's Piper nigrum crop as of 2008.
Dried ground pepper has been used since antiquity for दोनो its flavour and as a medicine.
Black pepper is the world 's सबसे traded spice.
It is one of the most common spices added to European cuisine and its descendants.
The spiciness of black pepper is due to the chemical piperine, not to be confused with the capsaicin that gives fleshy peppers theirs.
It is in the modern world, often paired with salt.
Fire hydrant in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA
A fire hydrant ( also known colloquially as a fire plug in the United States or as a johnny pump in New York City ), is an active fire protection measure, and a source of water provided in most urban, suburban and rural areas with municipal जल सेवा to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire.
Buildings near a hydrant may qualify for an insurance discount since अग्निशमन should be समर्थ to more rapidly extinguish a fire on the insured property.
The concept of fire plugs dates to at least the 17th century.
इस was a time when firefighters responding to a call would dig down to the wooden water mains and hastily bore a hole to secure water to fight fires.
The water would भरण the hole creating a temporary well, and be transported from the well to the fire by bucket brigades or, later, by hand-pumped आग engines.
The holes यहूद then plugged साथ stoppers, normally redwood, which over time came to be known as fire plugs.
The location of the plug would प्रायः be recorded or marked so that it could be reused in future fires.
This is the source of the colloquial term आग plug still used for fire hydrants today.
After the Great आग of London in 1666, the नगर installed water mains with holes drilled at intervals, equipped with risers, allowing an access point to the wooden fire plugs from street level.
The invention of a post- or pillar-type fire hydrant is generally credited to Frederick Graff sr., Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801.
It had a combination hose/faucet आउटलेट and was of `` wet बैरल '' design साथ the valve in the top.
It is said that graff held the first patent for a fire hydrant, but this can not be verified क्युकी the patent office in Washington D.C. caught on fire in 1836 destroying अनेक पेटेंट रिकॉर्ड from that period in the process.
the President of the Republic of South Africa is the head of state and head of सरकारी under South Africa 's Constitution.
इससे 1961 to 1994, the head of state was called the State President.
The President is elected by members of the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, and is usually the नेता of the largest party, जिससे has been the African National Congress since the first non-racial elections were आयोजित on 27 अप्रैल 1994.
The role was originally founded to be distinct from the now defunct role of prime minister, but the two roles were merged in the 1983 constitution which specified a four-year पद of office.
The 1993 and later constitutions limits the president 's time in office to two five-year terms.
The first President to be elected under the new संविधान was Nelson Mandela, and the incumbent president is याक़ूब zuma.
Under the interim Constitution ( valid from 1994 to 1996 ), there was a Government of National Unity, in जिससे an MP from the largest opposition party was entitled to a position as Deputy President.
Along with Thabo Mbeki, the last State President, F.W. De Klerk also served as Deputy President, in his capacity as the leader of the National Party which was the second-largest party in the new पार्लियामेंट.
But De Klerk later resigned and went into opposition with his party.
A voluntary coalition government continues to exist under the new constitution ( adopted in 1996 ), although there have been no appointments of opposition politicians to the post of deputy president.
Special education or special needs education is the education of students with special needs in a रास्ता that addresses the students ' व्यक्तिगत differences and needs.
Ideally, this process involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching प्रक्रियाओं, adapted equipment and materials, accessible settings, and other interventions designed to help learners with special needs achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency and success in school और community than would be available if the छात्र यहूद only given access to a ठेठ classroom education.
आम special needs include challenges with learning, संचार challenges, emotional and behavioral disorders, शारीरिक disabilities, and developmental disorders.
Students with these kinds of special needs are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching, उपयोग of technology, a specifically adapted teaching क्षेत्रफल, or संसाधन room.
Intellectual giftedness is a अंतर in learning and can also benefit from specialized teaching techniques or different educational programs, but the term `` special education '' is generally used to specifically indicate instruction of students whose special needs reduce their ability to learn independently or in an ordinary classroom, and gifted education is handled separately.
In most विकसित countries, educators are modifying शिक्षण methods and environments so that the अधिकतम क्रमांक of students are served in general education environments.
खास education in developed countries is often regarded less as a `` place '' and अधिक as `` a range of services, available in every school. ''
Integration can reduce social stigmas and improve academic achievement for many students.
The opposite of special education is general education.
General education is the standard curriculum presented with standard teaching विधि and without additional supports.
George Soros ( or ; ; ; born August 12, 1930, as Schwartz György ) is a Hungarian-American business magnate, निवेशकों, and philanthropist.
He is the chairman of Soros Fund Management.
Soros supports progressive-liberal causes.
He is known as `` The Man Who Broke the बैंको of England `` because of his in investment profits during the 1992 Black Wednesday uk currency crisis.
Between 1979 and 2011, Soros gave दूर over $ 8 billion to human rights, public health, and education causes.
He played a significant role in the peaceful transition from communism to capitalism in Hungary ( 1984–89 ) and provided one of Europe 's largest higher education endowments to Central European University in Budapest.
Soros is also the अध्यक्ष of the Open Society संस्थान.
An actor portraying Alexander ग्राहम Bell speaking into an early model telephone.
The invention of the telephone is the culmination of work done by अनेक individuals, the history of which involves a संग्रहण of claims and counterclaims.
The development of the modern electrical telephone involved an array of lawsuits founded upon the patent claims of several individuals and numerous companies.
This article covers the early years from 1844 to 1898, from conception of the idea of an इलेक्ट्रिक voice-transmission device, to failed attempts to use `` make-and-break '' current, to successful experiments with electromagnetic telephones by Alexander ग्राहम Bell and थामस Watson, और finally to commercially successful telephones in the late 19th century.
A निपुण of Fine Arts ( MFA, M.F.A. ) is a graduate degree typically requiring 2–3 years of postgraduate study beyond the bachelor 's degree ( BFA ), although the term of study will vary by country or by university.
The MFA is a creative degree usually awarded as a टर्मिनल degree in visual arts, creative writing, filmmaking, dance, or theatre and other performing arts.
Coursework is primarily of an applied or performing nature with the program often culminating in a प्रमुख work or performance.
Master of Fine Arts programs have generally required a bachelor 's degree prior to admission, but many do not require कि the undergraduate major be the वही as the MFA field of study.
The most important admissions requirement has often been a sample portfolio or a performance audition.
The Master of Fine कला differs from the Master of Arts in कि the MFA, while an अकादमिक program, centers around practice in the particular field, whereas programs leading to the MA usually center on the scholarly, academic, or critical study of the field.
Additionally, in the United States, an MFA is recognized as a terminal degree लिये practitioners of Visual Art, Design, Dance, Theatre, Film/Video, नई Media, and Creative Writing - meaning that it is माना to be the highest degree in its field, and is प्रयुक्त as a minimum qualification to be able to apply to become a full-time Professor teaching at the University level in these disciplines.
There are exceptions to this standard in the Arts, notably in the मामला of म्यूज़िक performance, जहाँ the MFA is not seen as a terminal degree in the context of the more standardized dma degree.
It is also critical to note that in the interest of extending the connection between creative production and continued अकादमिक research, some universities have established practice-based Ph.D programs in fields ऐसे as creative writing, visual arts, नई media, design and theater.
While this has had an effect in Creative Writing, and to a lesser extent in design and new मीडिया, the influx of graduates from practice-based PhD programs has not appreciably changed the मानक for the MFA as the terminal degree in most Arts disciplines yet.
This is an ongoing contentious topic, and is the frequent subject of अकादमिक panels, especially at the annual कॉलेज Art Association conference.
The CAA 2008 guidelines regarding the MFA strongly re-affirms that the PhD is not required as a terminal degree in the visual arts.
The atomic bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan were conducted by the United States during the final stages of World War II in 1945.
The two events are the only use of नाभिकीय weapons in war to date.
Following a firebombing campaign that नष्ट many जापानी cities, the allies prepared for a costly invasion of Japan.
The war in Europe ended जब Nazi Germany हस्ताक्षरित its instrument of surrender on 8 May, but the Pacific War continued.
Together with the संयुक्त Kingdom और the Republic of China, the United States called for a surrender of Japan in the Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945, threatening Japan with `` prompt and utter destruction ''.
The Japanese government ignored इस ultimatum, and the United States deployed two नाभिकीय weapons developed by the Manhattan Project.
American airmen dropped Little लड़के on the city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, followed by Fat Man over Nagasaki on 9 August.
Within the पहला two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects मारे 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima और 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki, with roughly half of the deaths in each नगर occurring on the first day.
The Hiroshima prefecture health विभाग estimated that, of the people जो died on the day of the explosion, 60 % died from फ्लैश or flame burns, 30 % from falling debris and 10 % from other causes.
During the following months, large numbers died from the effect of burns, radiation sickness, और other injuries, compounded by illness.
In a US estimate of the कुल immediate and short term cause of death, 15–20 % died from radiation sickness, 20–30 % from burns, and 50–60 % from other injuries, compounded by illness.
In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizeable garrison.
On 15 August, six days after the bombing of नागासाकी, Japan announced its surrender to the Allies, signing the Instrument of Surrender on 2 September, officially ending World War II.
the bombings led, in part, to post-war Japan 's adopting Three Non-Nuclear Principles, forbidding the nation from nuclear armament.
The role of the bombings in Japan 's आत्मसमर्पण और उनके ethical justification are still debated.
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ( ; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948 ), commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled इण्डिया.
Employing non-violent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for non-violence, civil rights and freedom across the world.
the son of a senior government official, Gandhi was born and raised in a Hindu Bania community in coastal Gujarat, and trained in विधि in लंदन.
गांधी became प्रसिद्ध by fighting for the civil rights of Muslim and हिन्दू Indians in South Africa, using new techniques of non-violent civil disobedience that he विकसित.
Returning to India in 1915, he set about organising peasants to protest excessive land-taxes.
A lifelong opponent of `` communalism `` ( i.e. basing politics on religion ) he reached out widely to all धार्मिक groups.
He became a leader of Muslims protesting the declining status of the Caliphate.
Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women 's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, increasing आर्थिक self-reliance, and above all for achieving Swaraj —the independence of इण्डिया from British domination.
Gandhi led Indians in protesting the national salt tax with the Dandi Salt कूच in 1930, and later in demanding the British to तत्काल Quit India in 1942, during World War II.
He was imprisoned for that and for numerous अन्य political offenses over the years.
गांधी sought to practice non-violence and truth in all situations, and advocated that others do the same.
He saw the villages as the core of the true India and promoted self-sufficiency ; he did not support the industrialization programs of his disciple Jawaharlal Nehru.
he lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti और shawl, woven साथ yarn he had hand spun on a charkha.
His मुख्य political enemy in Britain was Winston Churchill, who ridiculed him as a `` half-naked fakir. ''
He was a dedicated vegetarian, and undertook long fasts as means of both self-purification and political mobilization.
In his last year, unhappy at the partition of India, Gandhi worked to stop the carnage between Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs that raged in the border area between इण्डिया and Pakistan.
He was assassinated on 30 January 1948 by Nathuram Godse who thought Gandhi was too sympathetic to India 's Muslims.
30 January is observed as Martyrs ' Day in India.
The honorific Mahatma ( `` Great Soul '' ) थी applied to him by 1914.
In India he was also called Bapu ( `` Father '' ).
he is known in India as the Father of the Nation ; his जन्मदिवस, 2 October, is commemorated there as Gandhi jayanti, a नेशनल holiday, and world-wide as the अंतरराष्ट्रीय Day of Non-Violence.
Gandhi 's philosophy was not theoretical लकिन one of pragmatism, that is, practicing his principles in the moment.
Asked to give a message to the people, he would respond, `` My जीवन is my message. ''
Joan Crawford ( March 23, ca. 1904 – May 10, 1977 ), born lucille Fay lesueur, was an American actress in film, television and theatre.
Starting as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting on Broadway, Crawford was हस्ताक्षरित to a motion picture अनुबंध by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925.
Initially frustrated by the size और विशेषता of her parts, क्रॉफर्ड began a campaign of self-publicity and became nationally ज्ञात as a flapper by the end of the 1920s.
In the 1930s, Crawford 's fame rivaled, and later outlasted, MGM colleagues norma Shearer and Greta Garbo.
Crawford प्रायः played hardworking young women who find रोमांस and financial success.
These `` rags-to-riches '' stories were well received by Depression -era ऑडियंस and were popular with women.
Crawford became one of Hollywood 's most prominent फिल्म stars and one of the highest paid women in the United States, but her films began losing money and by the end of the 1930s she थी labeled `` box office poison ''.
After an absence of nearly दो सालो from the screen, Crawford staged a comeback by starring in Mildred पियर्स ( 1945 ), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.
In 1955, she became involved with the Pepsi-Cola कम्पनी through her marriage to company Chairman Alfred Steele.
After his death in 1959, क्रॉफर्ड was elected to fill his vacancy on the board of directors लकिन was forcibly retired in 1973.
She continued एक्टिंग in film and television regularly through the 1960s, when her performances became fewer ; after the रिलीज of the British horror film trog in 1970, Crawford retired from the स्क्रीन.
Following a public appearance in 1974, after which unflattering photographs were published, Crawford withdrew from public life and became increasingly reclusive until her मौत in 1977.
Crawford married four times.
Her first three marriages ended in divorce ; the पिछला ended with the मौत of husband Alfred Steele.
She adopted five children, one of whom was reclaimed by his birth mother.
Crawford 's relationships with her two older children, क्रिस्टीना and Christopher, were acrimonious.
Crawford disinherited the two और, after Crawford 's death, Christina wrote a `` tell-all '' memoir, Mommie Dearest, in which she alleged a lifelong pattern of physical and emotional abuse perpetrated by क्रॉफर्ड.
She was voted the दसवाँ greatest मादा star in the history of अमरीकी cinema by the American Film संस्थान.

The Hangover is a 2009 American comedy film, co-produced and directed by Todd phillips and written by Jon Lucas and स्कॉट Moore.
It is the first film of The hangover मताधिकार.The film stars ब्राडली Cooper, ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Heather Graham, Justin Bartha, and Jeffrey Tambor.
The Hangover tells the स्टोरी of Phil Wenneck, Stu Price and Alan Garner, जो travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor पार्टी to celebrate their friend Doug Billings ' impending marriage.
However, Phil, Stu and Alan have no memory of the previous night 's events and must find Doug before the wedding can take place.
Lucas and Moore wrote the script after executive producer Chris Bender 's friend disappeared and had a large bill after being sent to a strip club.
बाद Lucas and मूर sold it to the studio for $ 2 million, Philips and Jeremy Garelick rewrote the script to include a tiger as well as a subplot involving a baby and a police cruiser, and also including boxer Mike Tyson.
Filming took place in Nevada for 15 दिनों, and during filming, the three main actors ( Cooper, Helms और Galifianakis ) formed a friendship.
The Hangover was released on June 5, 2009, becoming a critical and commercial success.
It became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2009, with a worldwide gross of over US $ 467 million.
आलोचकों praised the फिल्मी 's comedic approach but criticized it for its vulgarity.
The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, and received multiple अन्य accolades.
It is the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2009 in the world, as well as the second highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever in the संयुक्त States, surpassing a record previously held by Beverly Hills Cop for almost 25 years and later being surpassed by Ted in 2012.
आउट of all R-rated films, it is the third highest-grossing ever in the U.S., पीछे only The Passion of the मसीह and The Matrix Reloaded.
A sequel, The Hangover Part II, was released in 2011, and a तीसरा and final film, The Hangover Part III, is set for release in 2013.
Events involving meiosis, showing chromosomal crossover
Meiosis ( ) is a special type of cell division necessary for sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.
The cells produced by meiosis हैं गैमीट or spores.
In many organisms, including all पशु and land plants ( but not some other groups such as fungi ), gametes are called sperm and egg cells.
Whilst the process of meiosis bears a number of similarities with the 'life-cycle ' cell division process of mitosis, it differs in two important respects:
the chromosomes in meiosis undergo a recombination which shuffles the genes producing a different जेनेटिक combination in each gamete, compared with the co-existence of each of the two separate pairs of each chromosome ( one received इससे each parent ) in each cell which results from mitosis.
the निष्कर्ष of meiosis is potentially four ( genetically unique ) haploid cells, compared with the two ( genetically identical ) diploid cells उत्पादित from mitosis.
meiosis begins with one द्विगुणित cell containing two copies of each chromosome —one from the organism 's mother and one from its father.
The cell divides twice, potentially producing up to चार अगुणित cells containing one copy of each chromosome.
( `` potentially '' because in some cases, such as the formation of oocytes in mammals, only one of the संभावित four haploid cells survives. )
In animals the haploid कोशिका resulting इससे meiosis is a male or female gamete.
Each of the resulting गुणसूत्रों in the gamete cells is a unique mixture of maternal and paternal DNA, resulting in offspring that are genetically distinct from either parent.
This gives rise to genetic diversity in sexually reproducing populations.
This genetic diversity can provide the variation of शारीरिक and behavioural attributes ( phenotypes ) upon which प्राकृतिक selection can अधिनियम, but, as described नीचे in Section 6, Origin and function of meiosis, the genetic diversity may be largely a by-product of the homologous recombination that is primarily employed for its DNA repair function during meiosis.
It is also noteworthy that during meiosis, specific genes हैं more highly transcribed, and these are called the meiome, the term used in functional genomics for the meiotic transcriptome.
Meiosis is a key feature for all sexually reproducing eukaryotes in which homologous chromosome pairing, synapse and recombination occur.
In addition to strong meiotic stage-specific expression of mRNA ( the meiome ), however, there are also pervasive translational नियंत्रण ( e.g. selective usage of preformed mRNA ), regulating the ultimate meiotic stage-specific protein expression of genes during meiosis.
Thus, both the meiome and translational नियंत्रण determine the broad restructuring of meiotic cells needed to carry out meiosis.
Prior to the meiosis process the cell 's chromosomes are duplicated by a round of DNA replication, creating from the maternal and paternal versions of each chromosome ( homologs ) two exact copies, sister chromatids, संलग्न at the centromere region.
In the beginning of meiosis the maternal and paternal homologs pair to प्रत्येक other.
Then they typically exchange parts by homologous recombination leading to crossovers of DNA between the maternal and paternal versions of the chromosome.
Spindle fibers bind to the centromeres of each pair of homologs and arrange the pairs at the spindle equator.
Then the fibers pull the recombined homologs to विपरीत poles of the कोशिका.
As the chromosomes move away इससे the बीच the cell divides into two daughter cells, each containing a haploid number of chromosomes रचित of two chromatids.
बाद the recombined maternal and paternal homologs have separated into the two daughter cells, a second round of कोशिका division occurs.
There meiosis ends as the two sister chromatids making up each homolog are separated and move into one of the four resulting gamete cells.
Upon fertilization, for example when a sperm enters an egg cell, two gamete cells produced by meiosis fuse.
The gamete from the mother and the gamete from the father each contribute one हाफ of the set of chromosomes that make up the new offspring 's genome.
Meiosis uses many of the same mechanisms as mitosis, a type of कोशिका division used by eukaryotes like plants and animals to split one cell into two एकसमान daughter cells.
In सब plants and in many protists meiosis results in the formation of spores : haploid cells that can divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization.
Boxing ( pugilism, prize fighting, the sweet science or in Greek pygmachia ) is a martial art and combat sport in जिससे दो लोगों engage in a contest of strength, speed, reflexes, endurance and will by throwing punches with gloved hands.
Amateur boxing is an Olympic and Commonwealth sport and is a आम fixture in most of the major international games - it also has its own World Championships.
मुक्केबाज़ी is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds.
The परिणाम is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is disqualified लिये breaking a rule, resigns by throwing in a towel, or is सुनाया the winner or loser based on the judges ' scorecards at the end of the contest.
The birth hour of boxing as a sport may be its acceptance by the ancient Greeks as an Olympic game as early as 688 BC.
Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century, again initially in ग्रेट Britain and later in the United States.
In 2004, ESPN ranked मुक्केबाज़ी as the most difficult sport in the world.
Agreement or concord happens when a word changes form depending on the other words to which it relates.
It is an instance of inflection, and usually involves making the value of some grammatical category ( such as लिंग or person ) `` agree '' between different words or parts of the sentence.
For example, in Standard English, one may say I am or he is, but not `` I is '' or `` he am ''.
This is because the grammar of the language requires that the verb and its विषय agree in person.
The pronouns i और he are first and third person respectively, as are the verb forms am and is.
The verb रूप जरूर be selected so that it रै the same person as the subject.
The अनुबंध based on overt grammatical categories as above is formal agreement, in contrast to notional agreement, which is based on meaning.
लिये instance, the phrase The United States is treated as singular लिये purposes of agreement, भी though it is formally plural.

The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ( FMLA ) is a United States federal law requiring covered employers to provide employees job-protected and unpaid leave for qualified medical and family reasons.
Qualified medical and family कारण include : personal or family illness, family military leave, pregnancy, adoption, or the foster परवाह placement of a child.
The FMLA is administered by the Wage और Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor.
The विधेयक was a major part of President Bill Clinton 's agenda in his first term.
President Clinton signed the bill into law on February 5, 1993 ( ; 29 U.S.C. sec. 2601 ; 29 CFR 825 ) and it took effect on August 5, 1993, six months later.
The FMLA was intended `` to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families. ''
The Act allows eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to attend to the serious health condition of the employee, parent, spouse or child, or for pregnancy or care of a newborn child, or for adoption or foster परवाह of a child.
In अनुक्रम to be eligible for fmla leave, an कर्मचारी must have been at the business at तनिक 12 months, and worked at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months, and work at a location where the company employs 50 or more employees within 75 miles.
The FMLA covers both public- and private-sector employees, but certain categories of employees are excluded, including elected officials and their निजी staff members.
The Vietnam War ( ) was a Cold War -era military conflict कि occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.
This war followed the First Indochina War और was लड़ा between North Vietnam, supported by इसके communist allies, and the government of South Vietnam, supported by the United राज्य and other anti-communist countries.
The Viet Cong ( also known as the National Liberation सामने, or NLF ), a हलके armed South वियतनामी communist आम front directed by the North, largely fought a guerrilla war विरूद्ध anti-communist forces in the region.
The Vietnam People 's Army ( North Vietnamese Army ) engaged in a more conventional war, at times committing large units into battle.
U.S. and South वियतनामी forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations, involving ground forces, artillery, and airstrikes.
The U.S. government viewed involvement in the युद्ध as a way to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam as part of their wider strategy of containment.
The North Vietnamese government and Viet Cong were fighting to reunify Vietnam under communist rule.
They viewed the conflict as a colonial war, लड़ा initially विरूद्ध France, backed by the U.S., and later विरूद्ध South Vietnam, which it regarded as a U.S. puppet state.
American military advisors arrived in what was then French Indochina beginning in 1950.
U.S. involvement escalated in the जल्दी 1960s, with troop स्तर tripling in 1961 and tripling again in 1962.
U.S. combat units were तैनात beginning in 1965.
Operations spanned international borders, with Laos and कंबोडिया heavily bombed.
American involvement in the war peaked in 1968, at the time of the Tet Offensive.
After this, U.S. ground forces were gradually withdrawn as part of a policy known as Vietnamization.
Despite the Paris Peace Accords, signed by all पार्टियों in January 1973, fighting continued.
U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973 as a result of the Case–Church amendment passed by the U.S. Congress.
The capture of Saigon by the वियतनाम People 's Army in April 1975 marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year.
The war exacted a विशाल human cost in terms of fatalities ( see Vietnam War casualties ).
Estimates of the क्रमांक of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 800,000 to 3.1 million.
Some 200,000–300,000 Cambodians, 20,000–200,000 Laotians, and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the विरोध.
Cleveland Volcano in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska photographed from the अंतरराष्ट्रीय Space Station, May 2006.
Ash plumes reached a height of 19 km during the climactic eruption at Mount Pinatubo, Philippines in 1991.
A volcano is an opening, or rupture, in a planet 's surface or crust, which allows hot magma, volcanic ash and gases to escape from the magma chamber below the surface.
Volcanoes are generally found where tectonic प्लेटों are diverging or converging.
A mid-oceanic ridge, for example the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has examples of ज्वालामुखी caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling अलावा ; the Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming साथ.
By contrast, volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past एक another.
Volcanoes can also form where वहीँ is stretching and thinning of the Earth 's crust in the interiors of प्लेटों, e.g., in the East African Rift, the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and the Rio Grande Rift in उत्तर अमेरिका.
इस प्रकार of volcanism falls under the umbrella of `` Plate hypothesis '' volcanism.
Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes.
These so-called `` hotspots ``, for example Hawaii, are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core–mantle boundary, 3,000 km गहन in the Earth.
Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption.
Volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with जेट engines where राख particles can be melted by the high operating तापमान.
Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth 's lower atmosphere or troposphere ; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere.

A pothole ( sometimes पुकारा a kettle and known in भाग of the Western United States as a chuckhole ) is a प्रकार of disruption in the सतह of a roadway where a portion of the road सामग्री has broken away, leaving a hole.
Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC, also known as hypernephroma ) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, the very small tubes in the kidney that transport GF ( glomerular filtrate ) from the glomerulus to the descending limb of the nephron.
RCC is the most common type of गुर्दा cancer in adults, responsible for लगभग 80 % of मामले.
it is also known to be the most lethal of all the genitourinary tumors.
Initial treatment is most commonly a radical or partial nephrectomy and remains the mainstay of curative treatment.
Where the tumor is confined to the renal parenchyma, the 5-year survival rate is 60-70 %, but this is lowered considerably जहाँ metastases have spread.
It is relatively resistant to radiation therapy and chemotherapy, although some cases respond to immunotherapy.
targeted cancer therapies such as sunitinib, temsirolimus, bevacizumab, interferon-alpha, and sorafenib have improved the outlook for RCC.

The peritoneum ( ) is the serous membrane that forms the lining of the abdominal cavity or the coelom —it covers most of the intra-abdominal ( or coelomic ) organs—in amniotes and कुछ invertebrates ( annelids, for instance ).
It is composed of a layer of mesothelium supported by a thin layer of संयोजी tissue.
The peritoneum both supports the abdominal organs and serves as a conduit for their blood and lymph vessels and nerves.
The abdominal cavity ( the space bounded by the vertebrae, abdominal muscles, diaphragm and pelvic floor ) should not be confused with the intraperitoneal space ( located within the abdominal गुहा, but wrapped in peritoneum ).
The structures within the intraperitoneal स्पेस हैं called `` intraperitoneal '' ( e.g. the stomach ), the structures in the abdominal cavity that हैं located पीछे the intraperitoneal space are called `` retroperitoneal `` ( e.g. the kidneys ), और those structures below the intraperitoneal space are called `` subperitoneal '' or `` infraperitoneal '' ( e.g. the bladder ).

It uses an external power supply to make the DRAM non-volatile.
A solid-state drive ( SSD ) ( also known as a solid-state disk or electronic disk, though it contains no actual `` disk '' of any kind ) is a data storage device using integrated circuit assemblies as मेमोरी to store data persistently.
SSD technology उपयोग electronic interfaces compatible with traditional block input/output ( I/O ) hard disk drives.
SSDs have no moving mechanical components, which distinguish them from traditional electromechanical magnetic disks such as hard disk drives ( HDDs ) or floppy disks, which contain spinning disks and movable read/write heads.
Compared with electromechanical disks, SSDs are typically less susceptible to physical शॉक, much quieter, have lower अभिगम time, and less latency.
However, while the price of ssds has continued to decline in 2012, SSDs हैं still about 7 to 8 times more expensive per unit of storage than HDDs.
अनेक SSDs use I/O अंतरफलक developed for hard disk drives, thus permitting simple replacement in common applications.
, most SSDs use NAND-based flash memory, which retains data बगैर power.
लिये applications requiring fast access, but not necessarily data persistence after power घाटा, SSDs may be constructed from random-access memory ( RAM ).
Such devices may employ separate power sources, such as batteries, to maintain data after power loss.
Hybrid drives or solid state hybrid drives ( SSHD ) combine the features of SSDs and hdds in the same unit, containing a large hard disk drive and an SSD संचय to improve performance of frequently accessed data.
These devices may offer near-SSD प्रदर्शन for many अनुप्रयोग.
Salmon roe ( left ) and sturgeon caviar ( right ) served with mother of pearl caviar spoons to avoid tainting the taste of the caviar.
Ossetra caviar, salmon creme fraiche, potato shallot croquette, basil आयल, अंडा whites and yolks
Caviar, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, is a product made from salt-cured fish-eggs of the Acipenseridae family.
The roe can be `` fresh '' ( non-pasteurized ) or pasteurized, with pasteurization reducing its culinary and economic value.
Traditionally the term caviar refers तभी to roe from wild sturgeon in the Caspian और Black Seas ( Beluga, Ossetra and Sevruga caviars ).
Depending on the country, caviar may also be used to describe the roe of other fish such as सामन, steelhead, trout, lumpfish, whitefish, and अन्य species of sturgeon.
Caviar is considered a लक्ज़री delicacy and is eaten as a garnish or a स्प्रेड.
In 2012, caviar बेची for $ 2,500 per pound, or $ 3,000 to $ 5,500 per kilo.

The 1990s, pronounced and also known as `` the Nineteen-Nineties '' or abbreviated as `` the Nineties '' or `` the '90s '', was a decade that began on January 1, 1990, and ended on December 31, 1999.
It was the 10th and last दशक of the 20th century और the 100th and last decade of the 2nd millennium.
The decade is best known for the end of the ठंडा War at the beginning of the decade और the expansion and commercialization of the Internet during the second half of the decade.
In much of the West the 1990s is remembered as a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity, though many parts of the so-called Third World faced various problems including genocide, AIDS and नई or continuing ethnic tensions and civil wars.
Culturally speaking the decade was characterized by the वृद्धि of multiculturalism and alternative media.
Movements such as grunge, the rave scene and hip hop spread around the world to young people during the decade, aided by then-new technology such as cable television and the Internet.
A combination of कारकों, including the mass mobilization of capital markets through neoliberalism, the beginning of the फैली proliferation of new media such as the Internet, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a realignment and reconsolidation of economic and political power आरपार the world, and within countries.
Income inequality among countries in the world rose sharply between the 1980s and the mid-1990s, before levelling off and then falling after 2000.
New ethnic conflicts emerged in Africa, the balkans and the काकेशस, the former two which led to the Rwandan genocide and बोस्नियाई genocide, क्रमशः.

The gray wolf or grey wolf ( Canis lupus ) is a species of canid native to the wilderness and remote areas of उत्तर America, यूरेशिया, and North अफ़्रीकी.
It is the largest member of its family, with males averaging, and females.
It is similar in general appearance and proportions to a German shepherd, or sled dog, but has a larger head, narrower chest, longer legs, straighter tail and bigger paws.
Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in colour, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur.
Within the genus Canis, the gray भेड़िया represents a more specialised और progressive form than its smaller cousins ( the coyote and golden jackal ), as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature and its highly advanced expressive बर्ताव.
It is a social animal, यात्राएं in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the जोड़ी 's adult offspring.
The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it.
It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.
The gray wolf is one of the world 's most खूब researched animals, with probably अधिक किताबे written about it than any अन्य वन्यजीव species.
It रै a long history of association with इंसानो, having been despised and hunted in most agricultural communities due to its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected by some Native American tribes.
It is the sole ancestor of the dog, which was first domesticated in the मध्य ईस्ट.
Although the भय of wolves is prevalent in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies.
Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is unusual, as wolves हैं relatively few, live away from people, and have been taught to fear humans by hunters and shepherds.
Hunting and trapping has reduced the species ' दायरा to, though its still relatively widespread range and stable population means that the species is not threatened at a global स्तर, और is इसलिए classified by the IUCN as तनिक Concern.
the रोमन Empire ( ) was the post- Republican period of the प्राचीन Roman civilization, characterised by an autocratic form of government और large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean in यूरोपीय, Africa, and Asia.
the 500-year-old Roman Republic, which preceded it, had been destabilized through a series of civil wars.
अनेक events marked the transition from Republic to साम्राज्य, including Julius Caesar 's appointment as perpetual dictator ( 44 BC ) ; the Battle of Actium ( 31 bc ) ; and the granting of the honorific Augustus to Octavian by the Roman Senate ( 27 BC ).
The first two centuries of the Empire were a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( `` रोमन Peace '' ).
It reached its greatest expanse during the reign of Trajan ( 98–117 AD ).
In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a crisis that threatened its existence, but was reunified and stabilized अंतर्गत the emperors Aurelian and Diocletian.
Christians rose to power in the 4th century, during which time a system of dual rule was developed in the Latin West and Greek East.
After the collapse of सेंट्रल government in the West in the 5th century, the eastern half continued as what होता later be ज्ञात as the Byzantine Empire.
Because of the साम्राज्य 's vast extent and long endurance, the institutions and culture of Rome had a profound and lasting influence on the development of language, religion, वास्तुकला, philosophy, law, and forms of government in the territory it governed, particularly Europe, and by means of European expansionism throughout the modern world.
Education in the United States is mainly provided by the public सेक्टर, with control and funding coming from three levels : local, state, and federal, in that order.
चाइल्ड education is अनिवार्य, and there are भी a large number और wide variety of higher education institutions throughout the country that एक can choose to attend, both publicly and privately administered.
Public education is universally उपलब्धियाँ.
School curricula, funding, teaching, employment, and other policies are set through locally elected school फलक with jurisdiction over स्कूल districts with many directives from state legislatures.
School districts are usually separate from other local jurisdictions, with independent officials and budgets.
शैक्षणिक standards and standardized testing निर्णय are usually made by state governments.
The ages for compulsory education vary by state.
It begins from ages five to eight and ends from ages fourteen to अठारह.
Compulsory education requirements can generally be satisfied by educating children in public स्कूलों, state-certified private schools, or an approved home school program.
In सबसे public और private स्कूलों, education is divided into three levels : elementary school, middle school ( sometimes called junior high school ), and high school ( sometimes referred to as secondary education ).
In almost all schools at these levels, children are divided by age groups into grades, ranging from kindergarten ( followed by first grade ) for the youngest children in elementary school, up to twelfth grade, the final साल of high school.
The सटीक age range of students in these grade levels varies slightly from area to क्षेत्रफल.
Post-secondary education, better ज्ञात as `` college `` in the United States, is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system, and is described in a separate section below.
Government supported, free पब्लिक schools for all started being established after the revolution, and expanded in the 19th century, as the results of efforts of men like Horace Mann और Booker T. Washington.
By 1870, all states had फ़्री elementary schools, albeit only in urban centers.
as the 20th century drew nearer, states started passing laws to make schooling compulsory, and by 1910, 72 percent of children attended स्कूल.
Private schools continued to spread during this time, as well as colleges and—in the rural centers— land grant colleges.
The year of 1910 also saw the first true ऊँची schools.
दौरान the rest of the 20th century, educational efforts centered on reducing the असमानता of the schooling system.
The landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education बना the desegregation of elementary and high schools a national priority, while the pell Grant program helped poor minorities gain access to college.
Special education was made into federal law in 1975.
The elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 made standardized testing a requirement, and in 1983, a commission was established to evaluate their results और propose a course of action.
The resulting No Child बाएँ Behind Act of 2001 was controversial and its goals proved to be unrealistic.
A commission established in 2006 evaluated higher education, but its recommendations have yet to be fully implemented.

Health spending per capita, in $ US PPP-adjusted, with the US और Canada compared amongst other first world nations.
Comparison of the health care systems in Canada and the United States हैं प्रायः made by government, public health and public policy analysts.
The two देशों had समान health care systems before कनाडा reformed its system in the 1960s and 1970s.
The संयुक्त States spends much more money on health care than Canada, on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP.
In 2006, per-capita spending for health care in Canada was us $ 3,678 ; in the U.S., US $ 6,714.
The U.S. spent 15.3 % of GDP on health care in that year ; Canada spent 10.0 %.
In 2006, 70 % of health care spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46 % in the संयुक्त States.
Total government spending per capita in the u.S. on health care was 23 % higher than Canadian government spending, and u.S. government expenditure on health care was बस under 83 % of total Canadian spending ( public and private ) though these statistics do n't लो into account population मतभेद.
Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending.
A 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that `` health outcomes may be श्रेष्ठ in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent. ''
Life expectancy is longer in Canada, and its infant mortality रेट is lower than that of the U.S., but there is debate about the underlying causes of these differences.
One commonly cited तुलना, the 2000 World Health Organization 's ratings of `` overall health service performance '', which used a `` composite measure of achievement in the level of health, the distribution of health, the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution '', ranked Canada 30th और the US 37th among 191 member राष्ट्र.
इस study rated the US `` responsiveness '', or quality of सेवा for individuals receiving treatment, as 1st, compared with 7th for Canada.
While the average life expectancy for Canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the US, simply comparing the life expectancy of two groups with different racial makeup and different obesity rates is likely not an effective way of determining which healthcare system is superior.
The जो 's study methods यहूद criticized by some analyses.
Although there is a measure of consensus that life-expectancy and infant mortality चिह्नित the most reliable ways to compare nation-wide health care, assuming the जनसांख्यिकी makeup is similar, a recent report by the Congressional Research Service carefully summarizes some recent data और notes the `` difficult research issues '' facing international comparisons.
The sound source has now broken through the sound speed barrier, and is traveling at 1.4 times the speed of ध्वनि, ( Mach 1.4 ).
Since the source is moving faster ( with a speed ) than the sound waves it creates, it actually leads the advancing wavefront.
The ध्वनि source will pass by a stationary observer ( with a speed ) before the observer actually hears the sound it creates.
As a result, an observer in front of the source will detect

The Tonight Show with Jay Leno is an American late-night talk show hosted by Jay Leno कि initially aired from May 25, 1992 to May 29, 2009, and resumed production on March 1, 2010.
The fourth अवतार of the Tonight दिखाएँ franchise made its debut on May 25, 1992, three days following Johnny Carson 's retirement as मेजबान of the कार्यक्रम.
The program originates from एनबीसी Studios in Burbank, California, and is broadcast Monday through Friday at 11:35 PM in the Eastern and Pacific time zones ( 10:35 PM Central / Mountain time ).
Unlike Carson or his predecessor Jack Paar, Leno only once utilized a guest host, preferring to host the series by himself.
On April 26, 1999, the दिखाएँ began broadcasting in 1080i HDTV, becoming the first American nightly talk show to be shot in high definition.
The show is shot in 16:9 aspect ratio.
the श्रेणी, which followed the same basic format as that of उसके predecessors ( an opening monologue followed by comedy routines, interviews and performances ), ran until May 29, 2009, after which लीनो was succeeded by Conan o'brien.
NBC signed Leno to a new deal for a nightly talk show in the 10:00 pm ET timeslot.
The primetime श्रेणी, titled The Jay Leno Show, debuted on September 14, 2009, following a similar स्वरूप to the Leno incarnation of Tonight.
Neither O'Brien 's version of the program, which premiered June 1, 2009, nor The jay लीनो Show generated the ratings that NBC had expected.
The network decided to move a condensed 30-minute version of Leno 's show to o'brien 's time slot, and o'brien 's Tonight Show a half-hour later.
This decision met with opposition from O'Brien, whose stint on The tonight Show ended January 22, 2010, after which he began his own बात show on TBS.
The Tonight Show with Jay Leno then began its second and वर्तमान incarnation, the छठे of the franchise, on March 1, 2010.
RFID chip next to a grain of राइस.
This chip contains a radio-frequency electromagnetic field coil that modulates an external magnetic field to transfer a coded identification number when queried by a reader device.
This small type is incorporated in consumer products, and implanted in pets, for identification purposes.
Radio-frequency identification ( rfid ) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency electromagnetic फ़ील्ड to transfer data, for the purposes of automatically identifying and tracking टैग attached to objects.
The tags contain electronically stored information.
कुछ tags are powered and read at short ranges ( a few meters ) via magnetic fields ( electromagnetic प्रेरण ).
अन्य use a लोकल power source ऐसे as a battery, or else have no battery but collect energy from the interrogating EM field, and then act as a passive transponder to emit microwaves or UHF radio waves ( i.e., electromagnetic radiation at high frequencies ).
Battery powered tags may operate at hundreds of meters.
Unlike a bar code, the tag does not necessarily need to be within लकीर of sight of the reader, and may be embedded in the tracked object.
RFID टैग are used in many उद्योग.
An RFID tag attached to an automobile during उत्पादन can be used to track its प्रगति through the assembly line.
दवाएँ can be tracked through warehouses.
Livestock and pets may have tags injected, allowing positive identification of the animal.
Since RFID tags can be attached to clothing, possessions, or भी implanted within लोगों, the सम्भावना of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised privacy चिंताएं.
Id, ego and super-ego are the three parts of the psychic apparatus defined in Sigmund Freud 's structural मॉडल of the psyche ; they are the three theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction mental life is described.
According to this model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends ; the super-ego plays the critical और moralizing भूमिका ; and the ego is the organized, realistic भाग that mediates between the desires of the id और the super-ego.
The super-ego can stop you from doing certain things कि your id may want you to do.
Even though the मॉडल is structural and makes reference to an apparatus, the id, ego and super-ego are functions of the mind rather than parts of the brain and do not correspond one-to-one with actual somatic structures of the दयालु dealt with by neuroscience.
The concepts themselves arose at a late stage in the development of Freud 's thought : the `` structural model '' ( जिससे succeeded उसके `` economic model '' and `` topographical model '' ) was पहला discussed in his 1920 essay `` Beyond the Pleasure Principle `` and थी formalized and elaborated upon three years later in his `` The Ego and the Id ``.
Freud 's proposal was influenced by the ambiguity of the term `` unconscious `` and its many conflicting uses.
Air Force ROTC emblem
The Air Force Reserve Officer प्रशिक्षण Corps ( AFROTC ) is one of the three primary commissioning sources for officers in the United राज्य Air Force, the other two being the United States Air Force Academy ( USAFA ) and Air Force Officer Training School ( OTS ).
A अधीनस्थ command of the Air University within the Air Education and Training Command ( AETC ), AFROTC is aligned under the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accessions and Citizen Development at Maxwell AFB, Alabama.
The Holm Center, formerly known as the Air Force अधिकारी Accession and Training Schools ( AFOATS ), retains direct जिम्मेदारी for both afrotc और OTS.
AFROTC is the largest and oldest source of commissioned अधिकारियों for the U.S. Air Force.
AFROTC 's stated mission is to produce विशेषता leaders लिये the U.S. Air Force.
AFROTC units are located on 144 college और university campuses with 984 additional institutions of higher learning participating in cross-town agreements that allow their विद्यार्थी to attend AFROTC classes at a nearby `` host '' college or university.
According to AFOATS HQ, in 2006, AFROTC commissioned 2,083 USAF Second lieutenants, with afrotc नामांकन ranging from 23,605 in 1985 to 10,231 in 1993, and around 13,000 enrolled today.
AFROTC units at कॉलेजों and universities are called `` detachments, '' and are typically headed by an active ड्यूटी USAF officer in the rank of कर्नल or lieutenant colonel who functions as दोनो the detachment Commander लिये USAF purposes and with the nominal title of Professor of Aerospace Studies ( PAS ) within the institution 's academic community.
Most colleges and universities will designate the AFROTC detachment as the Department of Aerospace Studies.
The pas is assisted by three to four Assistant Professors of aerospace Studies ( APAS ), all active duty USAF officers in the ranks of major or captain.
Three यूएसएएफ non-commissioned officers and one senior non-commissioned officer will typically provide सैन्य administrative support and हैं often augmented by one to two civilian staff support employees of the अकादमिक institution.
Within afrotc detachments, the students ( referred to as `` cadets '' ) are व्यवस्थित into wings, groups, squadrons, and flights, mirroring the USAF functional wing structure.
The AFROTC detachment 's cadet wing or cadet group is separated into two divisions : the General Military Course ( GMC ) consisting of the first two years of training, and the Professional Officer Course ( poc ) consisting of the last two years of training.
The AFROTC program is also divided into two training functions : the Academic Classroom Program ( Aerospace Studies classes ) and Cadet Activities ( i.e., Leadership Laboratory, Physical Training, और other training ).
Paper density ( also known as basis weight and grammage ) is a term used in the गूदा and paper industry and also for कपड़ा industry to denote a माप of mass of the product per unit of area for a type of fabric, paper or paperboard.
The term `` density '' is not used in its traditional sense of mass per unit volume.
`` Paper density '', rather, is a measure of the area density.
Paper products that let little or no light pass through ( e.g. poster board ) are considered dense or heavy.
Paper products कि allow some light to pass through ( e.g. tissue paper ) are माना lightweight.
In the pulp and paper industry, it is common to set a commercial पेपर machine to produce paper to a target paper density.
Paper density can also be used to distinguish paper from paperboard as the latter usually has a grammage greater than 134 g/m2.
Two ways of expressing paper घनत्व are commonly उपयोगd:
Expressed in grams per square meter ( g/m2 ), paper density is also known as grammage.
This is the measure used in most parts of the world.
Expressed in terms of the mass ( expressed as वज़न ) per number of sheets, it is known as basis वज़न.
the convention used in the United States and a few other countries using US paper sizes is pounds of a ream of 500 ( or in some cases 1000 ) sheets of a given ( raw, still uncut ) basis size.
Japanese paper is expressed as the weight in kg of 1000 sheets.

a food मार्गदर्शिका pyramid is a pyramid shaped guide of healthy भोजन divided into sections to show the recommended intake for each food group.
The पहला food pyramid थी published in Sweden in 1974.
The most widely known food pyramid was introduced by the United States Department of Agriculture in the year 1992, was updated in 2005, and then replaced in 2011.
Over 25 other countries and organisations have also प्रकाशित food pyramids.
Hans Christian Andersen ( ; often referred to in Scandinavia as H. C. Andersen ; April 2, 1805august 4, 1875 ) was a Danish लेखक and poet.
हालांकि a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is बेहतरीन remembered for his fairy tales, a literary genre he so mastered कि he himself has become as mythical as the tales he wrote.
Andersen 's popularity is not limited to children ; उसके stories—called, or `` fantastic tales '' —express themes that transcend age and nationality.
दौरान his lifetime he was acclaimed for having delighted children worldwide and was feted by royalty.
Andersen 's fairy tales, which have been translated into more than 125 languages, have become culturally embedded in the West 's collective consciousness, readily accessible to children, but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers as well.
They have inspired motion pictures, plays, ballets, and animated films.
Two figures locking eyes in Caravaggio 's The Fortune Teller
Eye contact occurs when `` two people look at each other 's eyes at the वही time. ''
In human beings, eye contact is a form of अशाब्दिक communication and is thought to have a large influence on सोशल behavior.
Coined in the early to mid-1960s, the term has आइये in the West to often define the act as a meaningful and important sign of विश्वास and social communication.
The customs and significance of eye contact vary widely between cultures, with religious and social differences often altering its meaning greatly.
The study of eye contact is sometimes known as oculesics.
Bed बग are parasitic कीट of the cimicid family that feed exclusively on blood.
The term most commonly refers to members of the genus Cimex of जिससे Cimex lectularius, the common bed bug, is the बेहतरीन known as it prefers to feed on human blood although other Cimex प्रजाति हैं specialized to other animals, e.g., bat bugs, C. pipistrelli ( यूरोपीय ), C. pilosellus ( western US ), and C. adjunctus ( entire eastern US ).
The name of the `` bed bug '' is derived from the preferred habitat of Cimex lectularius : warm houses और especially nearby or inside of beds and bedding or other sleep areas.
Bed bugs are mainly active at night, but are not exclusively nocturnal.
They प्रायः feed on their hosts without होने noticed.
A number of प्रतिकूल health effects may result from bed bug bites, including skin rashes, psychological effects, and allergic symptoms.
Diagnosis involves both finding bed bugs and the occurrence of compatible symptoms.
Bed bugs have been known as human parasites for thousands of years.
At a point in the early 1940s, they यहूद mostly eradicated in the developed संसार, but have increased in prevalence चूंकि 1995.
Because infestation of human habitats रै been on the increase, bed कीड़ा bites and related conditions have been on the rise as खूब.
The Book of Isaiah ( ) is the first of the Latter Prophets in the Hebrew Bible, preceding Ezekiel, Jeremiah and the Book of the Twelve.
( The order of the subsequent किताबे differs somewhat in the Christian Old Testament ).
The first 39 अध्याय prophesy doom लिये a sinful Judah and for all the nations of the world that oppose परमेश्वर, while the पिछला 27 prophesy the restoration of the nation of Israel and a new सृष्टि in God 's गौरवशाली भविष्य kingdom ; this section includes the Songs of the Suffering Servant, four separate passages referring to the nation of इसराईल, interpreted by Christians as prefiguring the coming of Jesus Christ.
Tradition ascribes authorship of the book to Isaiah son of Amoz, but now scholars widely agree that the book is the work of three different authors - few scholars deny this view, and those that do, do so for theological reasons.

The Kanab ambersnail, वैज्ञानिक name Oxyloma haydeni kanabensis or Oxyloma kanabense, is a critically endangered subspecies or प्रजाति of small, air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusc in the family Succineidae, the amber snails.
The common name of the amber snails is based on the shell, which is पारदर्शी and when empty usually resembles amber in color.
This species is endemic to the United States, specifically the state of Arizona और Utah, where it was first collected in the early 20th century.
It has been listed as endangered on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species चूंकि 8 August 1991.
This snail lives in wetlands, स्रोतों, and seeps, and only two of its natural habitats are known to exist : Three Lakes, a meadow near Kanab, Utah, and Vasey 's Paradise, a spring साथ the Colorado River within Grand Canyon National Park.
In its natural habitat it is rather polyphagous, feeding मुख्यतः on bacteria, plants and fungi, and reproduces during the summer.
Now considered a Critically Endangered species on the आईयूसीएन Red List of Threatened Species due to a series of factors ( including influence ), the Kanab ambersnail रै been reintroduced to three स्रोतों above the historic high water level along the Colorado River.

There are 45 लाख Hispanophones who speak Spanish as a first or second language, as well as six million Spanish language students, composing the largest national Spanish-speaking community outside of मैक्सिको and making Spanish the Romance language and the indo-european language साथ largest क्रमांक of native speakers in the world.
Roughly half of all U.S. Spanish speakers भी speak English `` very well, '' based on the self-assessment जनसांख्यिकी question respondents.
the language came to the country चूंकि the 16th and 17th centuries with the arrival of Spanish colonists in areas that would later become the states of Florida, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, एरिज़ोना, Nevada, Utah, and कैलिफ़ोर्निया and of the Spanish explorers - who explored areas of 42 states-.
Also west of Louisiana Territory was Spanish between 1763 - 1800 ( year of the French रिकवरी of territory ), after the French and Indian War.
After of the incorporation of these राज्य to the U.S. in first half of 19th century, the Spanish language was later reinforced by the acquisition of Puerto Rico in 1898 and by later waves of the Hispanic emigration, basically from Hispanic America, to the United States beginning in the second half of 19th सदी until today.

The Tokyo mew Mew manga and anime series features a cast of characters designed by Mia Ikumi.
The series takes place in Tokyo, Japan, where five adolescent लड़कियों, called Mew Mews, are infused with the DNA of endangered species to combat एलियंस attempting to take over the Earth.
The manga series is followed by a छोटी sequel series, Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode, which introduces a new Mew mew and a new threat.
The Mew Mews are led by the main character, Ichigo Momomiya, whose first task is to gather the other four Mew Mews : Mint Aizawa, Lettuce Midorikawa, Pudding Fong, और Zakuro fujiwara.
As the series progresses, Ichigo goes from having a crush on Masaya Aoyama to becoming his girlfriend जबकि trying to hide उसके secret दोगुना life from him.
The series antagonists include three aliens, kish, Pie, and Tart, and their leader, Deep Blue.
Originally from Earth, the aliens were forced to leave long ago due to deadly environmental परिवर्तन.
They have returned to kill the humans, who they feel are destroying their ग्रह, and reclaim the planet.
In a la Mode, middle school student Berry Shirayuki is introduced as the sixth Mew Mew and, in the absence of Ichigo, the temporary leader of the Mew mews.
A la Mode also introduces new set of antagonists, the संत Rose Crusaders, a group of human teenagers with various psychic abilities with a desire to create their own utopia.
Led by Duke, they make अनेक attempts to kill Berry, eventually turning the local populace against the Mew Mews.
Ikumi 's आरंभिक vision for Tokyo Mew Mew was a story called Tokyo Black Cat Girl that featured a cat-girl battling alien invaders.
After the story was transitioned to a more upbeat story of five female superheroes, the character designs were redone to have a lighter, अधिक रंगीन feel.
The main series characters were praised for being a perfect fit for the overall story, as खूब as for their cute appearances.
The characters introduced in a la Mode were also praised for उनके visual दिखावे, लकिन criticized as होने दोहराव of the original series.
The character Duke was also criticized for having a design reminiscent of the white supremacy group, the Ku Klux Klan.

Sedimentary rocks are प्रकार of rock कि are formed by the deposition of material at the Earth 's सतह and within लाशें of जल.
Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause mineral and/or organic particles ( detritus ) to settle and accumulate or minerals to precipitate from a solution.
Particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment.
Before being deposited, sediment थी formed by weathering and erosion in a source area, और then transported to the place of deposition by जल, wind, ice, mass movement or glaciers which are called agents of denudation.
The sedimentary rock कवर of the continents of the Earth 's crust is extensive, but the total contribution of sedimentary rocks is estimated to be only 8 % of the total volume of the crust.
Sedimentary rocks are only a thin veneer over a क्रस्ट consisting mainly of igneous and metamorphic rocks.
Sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers as strata, forming a structure called bedding.
The study of sedimentary rocks and rock strata provides information about the subsurface that is useful for civil engineering, for example in the construction of roads, houses, tunnels, canals or other constructions.
Sedimentary rocks are also important sources of natural resources जैसे coal, fossil fuels, drinking water or ores.
The study of the sequence of sedimentary rock strata is the main source for scientific knowledge about the धरती 's history, including palaeogeography, paleoclimatology and the history of life.
the scientific discipline that studies the properties and origin of sedimentary rocks is called sedimentology.
Sedimentology is दोनो part of geology and physical geography and overlaps partly with other disciplines in the धरती sciences, ऐसे as pedology, geomorphology, geochemistry or structural geology.

Saint पैट्रिक ( ; ; Modern ; ; c. 387 – 17 March c. 460 or c. 492 ) was a Romano-British Christian missionary and बिशप in Ireland.
Known as the `` Apostle of Ireland '', he is the primary संरक्षक saint of the island साथ साथ संतो Brigid and Columba.
दो authentic letters from him survive, from which come the only generally accepted details of his life.
When he थी about 16, he was captured from उसके home and taken as a slave to Ireland, where he lived for six years before escaping और returning to his परिवार.
After becoming a cleric, he returned to northern and western Ireland as an ordained bishop, but little is known about the places where he worked.
By the seventh century, he had already come to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland.
Most उपलब्धियाँ details of his life are from subsequent hagiographies, and these are now not accepted without detailed criticism.
The Annals of Ulster state that he arrived in Ireland in 432, ministered in Ulster around 443, and died in 457 or 461.
The text, however, distinguishes between `` Old Patrick '' ( thought to mean Palladius ) and `` Patrick, archapostle of the Scots, '' who died in 492.
The actual dates of Patrick 's जीवन can नहीं be fixed with certainty but, on a widespread interpretation, he was क्रियाशील as a missionary in Ireland during the second हाफ of the 5th century.
He is generally credited with being the first bishop of Armagh, Primate of All Ireland.
Saint Patrick 's Day is observed on March 17, the date of his death.
It is celebrated both inside and outside Ireland, as both a religious and, especially outside Ireland, secular holiday.
In the dioceses of Ireland, it is both a solemnity and a holy day of obligation ; बाहर Ireland, it can be a celebration of Ireland itself.
Line segments in the golden ratio
A golden rectangle with longer side a and shorter side b, when placed adjacent to a square with पहलू of length a, will produce a similar golden rectangle साथ longer side a + b and shorter side a.
This illustrates the relationship.
In mathematics और the arts, two quantities are in the सुनहरी ratio if the ratio of the sum of the quantities to the larger quantity is equal to the ratio of the larger quantity to the smaller one.
The figure on the right illustrates the geometric relationship.
Expressed algebraically:
where the Greek letter phi ( ) represents the golden अनुपात.
Its मान is:
The golden ratio is also called the golden खण्ड ( Latin : sectio aurea ) or golden mean.
Other names include extreme and mean अनुपात, medial section, divine proportion, divine section ( Latin : sectio divina ), सुनहरी proportion, golden काटें, and golden number.
Many 20th century artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially in the form of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing ( see Applications and observations below ).
Mathematicians since Euclid have पढ़ाई the properties of the golden ratio, including its appearance in the dimensions of a regular pentagon and in a golden rectangle, which can be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same aspect ratio.
The golden ratio has also been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects as well as man-made systems such as financial markets, in some cases based on dubious fits to आंकड़ा.

World War I ( WWI ) was a वैश्विक war centred in Europe that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918.
It was predominantly called the World War or the ग्रेट War इससे its occurrence until the start of World War II in 1939, and the First World War or World War I thereafter.
it involved सब the world 's ग्रेट powers, which were assembled in two opposing alliances : the allies ( based on the Triple entente of the संयुक्त Kingdom, France and Russia ) and the Central Powers ( originally the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy ; लकिन, as Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive against the अनुबंध, Italy did not डालें into the युद्ध ).
These alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy, Japan and the United States joined the Allies, और the उस्मानी साम्राज्य and Bulgaria the Central Powers.
Ultimately, more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million europeans, were mobilised in एक of the largest wars in history.
More than 9 million combatants were killed, largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility.
It was the fifth- deadliest conflict in world history, subsequently paving the way for various political changes, such as revolutions in अनेक of the nations involved.
One of the long-term causes of the war was the पुनरुत्थान of imperialism in the foreign नीतियों of the great powers of Europe.
More तत्काल, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the वारिस to the throne of Austria-Hungary, on 28 June 1914 by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary subsequently delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia.
Several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked.
Within weeks, the major powers were at war and, via their colonies, the conflict soon spread around the world.
On 28 July, the Austro-Hungarians fired the first shots of the war as preparation for the invasion of Serbia.
While the Russians mobilised, the Germans invaded neutral बेल्जियम and Luxembourg on the way to France, providing a casus belli for Britain 's declaration of war विरूद्ध Germany.
After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt—the so-called चमत्कार of the Marne —the Western Front settled into a static बैटल of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917.
On the Eastern Front, the रूसी army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians, but was stopped in इसके invasion of East Prussia by the Germans.
In November the Ottoman Empire joined the war, खोलने up fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia and the Sinai.
Italy and Bulgaria went to war in 1915 and Romania in 1916.
In Russia, the tsar 's government collapsed in March 1917 and a subsequent revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers.
After a 1918 जर्मनी offensive along the western front, the Allies drove वापस the Germans in a श्रेणी of successful offensives और American forces began entering the trenches.
Germany, which had its own ट्रबल with revolutionaries, agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918.
The war ended in victory for the Allies.
Events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts, as the भागीदार tried to mobilize their manpower and आर्थिक resources to fight a total war.
By the end of the war, four major imperial powers—the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires—ceased to exist.
The successor states of the former two lost a ग्रेट amount of territory, while the latter two were dismantled entirely.
The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states.
The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict.
The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires, the repercussions of Germany 's defeat and problems साथ the सन्धि of Versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to World War II.

An inning, or innings, is a fixed-length segment of a game in any of a variety of sports – सबसे notably cricket and baseball during which one team attempts to score while the other team attempts to prevent the first from scoring.
In cricket, the term innings is both singular and plural and is always spelled and pronounced with the terminal `` s ''.
in baseball and softball, the singular form is inning and only the plural takes an `` s ''.
In अनेक other sports, the length of the game is dictated by a clock and teams swap offensive and defensive roles dynamically by taking possession of a ball or similar item.
In baseball and cricket, however, one team, said to be `` batting '', attempts to score `` runs '' —see run ( baseball ) and run ( cricket ) —while the other team, कहा to be `` fielding '', attempts to prevent the scoring of runs and get members of the batting team out.
The teams switch places after the fielding team has succeeded in getting a fixed number of players आउट, making a clock unnecessary.
In cricket, the term innings is also used to refer to the play of one particular player ( Smith had a poor innings, scoring तभी 12 ).
By extension, this term can be used in British English for almost any कार्यकलाप which takes a period of time ( the Liberal government था a good पारी, लकिन finally lost office in 1972, or You 've had a fair innings, now it 's my turn, meaning `` you have spoken for long enough, now let me speak '' ).
It is also used in reference to someone who has died at a reasonably old age or lived a rich and rewarding life ( Ah, well.
John was 89.
At least he था a good innings ).
The baseball-derived parallel to this in American English is the term at bat.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term innings रै been used in reference to क्रिकेट since at तनिक 1735.
As क्रिकेट was a mature, highly organized sport in the 1600s in England, the term 's origin could well precede this first recorded usage.
The word inning meaning 'a gathering in ' is first recorded in 1522, and could be related.

An example of urban poverty in this slum in Jakarta, Indonesia
Poverty is the state of one who lacks a certain amount of material possessions or money.
Absolute poverty or destitution refers to the deprivation of basic human needs, which commonly includes खाना, water, sanitation, clothing, shelter, health care and education.
सापेक्ष poverty is defined contextually as economic inequality in the location or समाज in which people live.
For much of history, poverty was considered largely unavoidable as traditional modes of production were insufficient to give an entire population a comfortable standard of living.
After the industrial revolution, mass production in factories made माल increasingly more inexpensive and accessible.
Of अधिक महत्व is the modernization of agriculture, such as fertilizers, in order to provide enough yield to feed the population.
The supply of basic needs can be restricted by constraints on सरकारी services such as भ्रष्टाचार, tax avoidance, debt and ऋण conditionalities and by the brain drain of स्वास्थ्य care and educational professionals.
Strategies of increasing income to make basic needs more affordable typically include welfare, economic freedoms, and providing financial services.
Poverty reduction is a major goal and issue for many international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank.
The World Bank estimated 1.29 billion people were living in absolute poverty in 2008.
of these, about 400 million people in absolute poverty lived in India and 173 million people in China.
In यूएसए 1 in 5 children lives in poverty.
in terms of percentage of regional populations, sub-Saharan Africa at 47 % था the highest incidence rate of absolute poverty in 2008.
between 1990 and 2010, about 663 million people moved above the absolute poverty level.
Still, extreme poverty is a global challenge ; it is observed in all parts of the world, including the developed economies.
Mushroom poisoning ( also known as mycetism ) refers to harmful effects from ingestion of toxic substances present in a mushroom.
These symptoms can vary from slight gastrointestinal discomfort to death.
The toxins present are secondary metabolites produced in specific biochemical pathways in the fungal कोशिकाएं.
Mushroom poisoning is usually the result of ingestion of जंगली mushrooms after misidentification of a toxic mushroom as an edible species.
The most आम reason for this misidentification is close resemblance in terms of colour and general morphology of the toxic मशरूम species with edible प्रजाति.
Even very experienced wild mushroom gatherers are upon rare occasion poisoned by eating toxic species, despite being well aware of the risks, through carelessness.
To prevent mushroom poisoning, mushroom gatherers need to be very familiar with the mushrooms they intend to collect as well as with any similar-looking toxic species.
In addition, edibility of mushrooms may depend on methods of preparation for cooking.
Collectors also need to be well aware that edibility or toxicity of some species varies with भौगोलिक location.
Human height is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a human देह, standing erect.
When populations share genetic background and environmental factors, average height is frequently characteristic within the group.
Exceptional height variation ( around 20 % deviation from average ) within such a population is sometimes due to gigantism or dwarfism, which are medical conditions caused by specific genes or endocrine abnormalities.
In regions of extreme poverty or prolonged warfare, environmental factors like chronic malnutrition during childhood or adolescence may account for delayed growth and/or ( in severe cases ) marked reductions in adult stature even without the presence of any of these medical conditions.
Apollo 11 थी the spaceflight that landed the पहला इंसानो, Americans Neil Armstrong और Buzz Aldrin, on the Moon on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC.
Armstrong became the first to step onto the चंद्र surface 6 घंटों later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC.
Armstrong spent about two और a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less ; and साथ they collected of lunar सामग्री for return to Earth.
A third member of the mission, Michael कॉलिन्स, piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to Earth.
Launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Merritt द्वीप, Florida on जुलाई 16, Apollo 11 was the पांचवां manned mission of NASA 's Apollo program.
The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts which was the only part which landed back on Earth ; a Service Module which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen और water ; and a Lunar Module for landing on the Moon.
After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and travelled for three days until they entered into चंद्र orbit.
Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module और landed in the Sea of tranquility.
They stayed a total of about 21 and a half hours on the चंद्र सतह.

In many areas, people with average acuity जो nonetheless have a visual field of कम than 20 degrees ( the norm being 180 degrees ) are also classified as being legally blind.
Approximately ten percent of those deemed legally blind, by any measure, have no vision.
The rest have some दृष्टि, from light perception alone to relatively good acuity.
कम vision is sometimes used to describe visual acuities from 20/70 to 20/200.
By the 10th Revision of the WHO अंतरराष्ट्रीय Statistical वर्गीकरण of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, कम vision is defined as विज़ुअल acuity of less than 20/60 ( 6/18 ), but equal to or बेहतर than 20/200 ( 6/60 ), or corresponding visual फ़ील्ड loss to less than 20 degrees, in the better eye with best possible correction.
Blindness is defined as visual acuity of less than 20/400 ( 6/120 ), or सम्बन्धित visual फ़ील्ड loss to less than 10 degrees, in the बेहतर eye with best possible correction.
Blind people with undamaged eyes may still पंजीकरण light non-visually for the purpose of circadian entrainment to the 24-hour light/dark cycle.

पाचन is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into smaller components that are more easily absorbed into a blood stream, for instance.
Digestion is a form of catabolism : a breakdown of विशाल food molecules to smaller ones.
When खाना enters the mouth, digestion of the खाना starts by the कार्रवाई of mastication, a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva.
Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary ग्रंथियों, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the पाचन of starch in the food.
After undergoing mastication and starch पाचन, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus.
It will then travel down the esophagus और into the stomach by the कार्रवाई of peristalsis.
Gastric juice in the stomach starts प्रोटीन digestion.
Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin.
As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the पेट, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals.
At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which are waves of muscular contractions that मूव साथ the stomach wall.
This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.
After some time ( typically an hour or two in humans, 4–6 hours in dogs, somewhat shorter duration in house cats ), the resulting thick liquid is called chyme.
When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas, and then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues.
When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood.
95 % of absorption of nutrients occurs in the छोटी intestine.
Water and minerals हैं reabsorbed back into the blood in the कोलन ( large intestine ) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9.
Some विटामिन, such as biotin and विटामिन K ( K2MK7 ) उत्पादित by bacteria in the कोलन are also absorbed into the blood in the colon.

Henry VIII ( 28 June 1491 – 28 January 1547 ) was king of England from 21 April 1509 until his death.
He was lord, and बाद king, of Ireland, as well as continuing the nominal claim by the English monarchs to the किंगडम of France.
Henry थी the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty, succeeding उसके father, Henry VII.
Besides his छह marriages, Henry viii is known for his role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church.
Henry 's struggles साथ Rome led to the विरह of the Church of England from papal authority, the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and his own establishment as the Supreme Head of the Church of England.
Yet he remained a believer in core कैथोलिक theological teachings, even after his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church.
Henry oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales अधिनियमों 1535 and 1542.
In 1513, the new king allied with the Holy Roman Emperor, maximillian I, and invaded France in 1513 with a large, well-equipped army, but achieved little at a considerable financial cost.
Maximillian, for his part, प्रयुक्त the English invasion to his own ends, और this prejudiced England 's ability to defeat the French.
This foray would prove the start of an obsession for Henry, who invaded again in 1544.
इस time, Henry 's forces captured the important नगर of Boulogne, but again the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, supported Henry only as long as he needed to and England, strained by the विशाल cost of the युद्ध, ransomed the city back for peace.
उसके contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive, educated and accomplished king, and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne ''.
Besides ruling with absolute शक्ति, he also engaged himself as an author and composer.
His ख्वाहिश to provide England with a male heir – which stemmed partly from personal vanity and partly because he believed a daughter would be unable to consolidate the Tudor dynasty and the fragile peace that existed following the Wars of the Roses – led to the two things for which Henry is most remembered : his six marriages and the English Reformation.
Henry became morbidly obese and his health suffered, contributing to his death in 1547.
He is frequently characterised in his बाद life as a lustful, egotistical, harsh, and insecure king.

Dred स्कॉट v. Sandford,, भी known as the Dred Scott निर्णय, was a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.
It made two main rulings.
The पहला ruling थी कि African-Americans were not citizens, and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court.
the second ruling was that the federal government had no शक्ति to regulate slavery in any territory acquired subsequent to the सृष्टि of the United States.
Given the पहला ruling, most scholars and अनेक contemporary political figures ( सहित the नेतृत्व of the then-new Republican पार्टी ) considered कि the second ruling was not binding precedent, but mere dictum.
The rationale of the Supreme Court regarding the jurisdictional ruling implied that people of African descent ( both slave and free ) were not protected by the Constitution and were not U.S. citizens.
Since passage of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, दोनो rulings are superseded and no longer valid precedent.
Nonetheless, the case retains historical significance as it is widely regarded as the worst decision ever made by the Supreme Court.
The opinion of the court, written by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, stirred debate.
the decision was 7–2, and every Justice besides Taney wrote a separate concurrence or dissent.
For the first time since Marbury v. Madison, the Court held an Act of Congress to be unconstitutional.
Dred Scott, an African-American slave, had asked a संयुक्त States Circuit Court to award him his freedom because he and his master था resided in a state ( Illinois ) and a territory ( Wisconsin Territory ) where slavery had been banned.
Chief Justice Roger Taney, writing for the court, held that स्कॉट, as a person of African ancestry, was not a citizen of the United States and therefore had no right to sue in संघीय court.
इस holding was contrary to the practice of numerous states at the time, particularly Free states, where free blacks किया in fact enjoy the rights of citizens, ऐसे as the right to vote and hold public office.
In what is sometimes considered mere obiter dictum, the Court गई on to hold that Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in संघीय territories because slaves are personal property and the पांचवां Amendment to the Constitution protects property owners against पिछडे of their property बगैर due process of law.
In reaching this decision, Taney had hoped to settle the growing controversy surrounding slavery in the United States, but it had the opposite effect.

''
To जिससे the Court noted:
The first observation we have to make on this clause is, कि it puts at rest both the questions which we stated to have been the subject of मतभेद of opinion.
It declares that persons may be citizens of the United राज्य बगैर regard to their नागरिकता of a particular State, and it overturns the dred Scott निर्णय by बनाना all persons born within the United States and subject to its jurisdiction citizens of the United States.

Artist 's conception of a protoplanetary disk
The formation और of the Solar System is अनुमानित to have begun 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational पतन of a small part of a giant molecular cloud.
Most of the collapsing mass collected in the centre, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.
This widely accepted model, known as the nebular परिकल्पना, was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace.
Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of वैज्ञानिक disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, और planetary science.
Since the भोर of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar ग्रह in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and परिष्कृत to account लिये new observations.
The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation.
Many moons have formed from घूमना discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later महरूम captured by their planets.
स्टिल others, as the Earth 's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions.
Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System.
The positions of the ग्रह often shifted, and planets have switched places.
This planetary migration is now thought to have been जिम्मेदार for much of the Solar System 's early evolution.
In roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward many times its current diameter ( becoming a रेड giant ), before casting off इसके बाहरी परतों as a planetary नीहारिका and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf.
in the far distant future, the gravity of गुजर stars will gradually reduce the Sun 's retinue of planets.
Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space.
Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of सालो, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the असली bodies in orbit around it.

Although mostly documented in मेन, there are also महिलाओं who exhibit the disorder, and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles.

पहला trophic level.
The plants in this image, and the algae and phytoplankton in the lake, are primary producers.
They take nutrients from the soil or the water, and manufacture their own food by photosynthesis, using energy from the सूर्य.
The trophic level of an organism is the position it occupies in a food chain.
The word trophic derives from the Greek τροφή ( trophē ) referring to food or feeding.
A food कड़ी represents a succession of organisms that eat another organism and are, in turn, eaten themselves.
The number of steps an organism is from the start of the chain is a measure of इसके trophic level.
Food chains start at trophic level 1 with primary producers ऐसे as plants, मूव to herbivores at level 2, predators at level 3 and typically finish with carnivores or apex predators at level 4 or 5.
The path along the chain can form either a one-way flow, or a food `` web. ''

The protein fibre of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and produced by certain insect larvae to रूप cocoons.
The best-known type of silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity ( sericulture ).
The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism -like structure of the silk fibre, जिससे allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at अलग कोण, thus producing different colors.
Silks are produced by several other insects, but generally only the silk of शलभ caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing.
There has been some research into other silks, which differ at the molecular level.
Many silks are mainly produced by the लार्वे of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis, but some adult insects such as webspinners produce silk, and कुछ insects such as raspy crickets produce रेशा throughout their lives.

A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority, or control on the Internet.
Domain names are formed by the rules और procedures of the Domain नाम System ( DNS ).
Technically, any name registered in the DNS is a domain name.
Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes.
In general, a डोमेन name represents an Internet Protocol ( IP ) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet.
Domain names are organized in subordinate levels ( subdomains ) of the DNS रूट domain, which is nameless.
The first-level नियत of domain names are the top-level domains ( TLDs ), including the generic top-level domains ( gTLDs ), such as the prominent domains com, सूचना, जाल and org, and the country code top-level domains ( ccTLDs ).
Below these top-level domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically open for reservation by end-users जो wish to connect local क्षेत्रफल networks to the Internet, create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites.
The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain name registrars who sell their services to the पब्लिक.
A fully qualified domain name ( FQDN ) is a डोमेन name that is completely specified in the पदानुक्रम of the DNS, having no omitted parts.
Domain names are usually लिखा in lowercase, although labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive.

In economics, the money supply or money stock, is the total amount of monetary assets available in an economy at a specific time.
There are several ways to define `` धन, '' but standard measures प्रायः include currency in circulation and demand जमा ( जमाकर्ताओं ' easily accessed एसेट on the books of financial institutions ).
धन supply data are अंकित and प्रकाशित, प्रायः by the government or the central बैंको of the country.
Public and private sector विश्लेषकों have long monitored changes in money supply because of its effects on the price level, inflation, the exchange rate and the business cycle.
That relation between money and prices is historically associated with the quantity सिद्धान्त of money.
वहीँ is strong empirical evidence of a direct relation between money-supply growth and long-term price inflation, at least लिये rapid increases in the amount of money in the अर्थव्यवस्था.
That is, a country such as Zimbabwe जिससे देखी rapid increases in its money supply also saw rapid increases in prices ( hyperinflation ).
This is one reason for the reliance on monetary policy as a अर्थात् of controlling inflation.
The nature of this causal chain is the subject of contention.
Some heterodox economists argue that the money supply is endogenous ( संकल्पित by the workings of the economy, not by the central bank ) and that the sources of महंगाई must be found in the distributional structure of the economy.
In addition, those economists seeing the central bank 's control over the money supply as feeble say that there हैं two weak links between the growth of the money supply and the inflation rate.
First, in the aftermath of a recession, when many resources are underutilized, an increase in the money supply can cause a sustained increase in real production instead of inflation.
Second, if the velocity of money, i.e., the ratio between nominal जीडीपी and धन supply, परिवर्तन, an increase in the money supply could have either no effect, an exaggerated effect, or an unpredictable प्रभाव on the growth of नाममात्र GDP.

Most commonly इस will be the sacrum, coccyx, heels or the hips, but other sites such as the elbows, knees, ankles or the back of the cranium can be affected.

These factors are protein-calorie malnutrition, microclimate ( skin wetness caused by sweating or incontinence ), diseases that reduce blood flow to the skin, such as arteriosclerosis or diseases that reduce the feeling in the skin, such as paralysis or neuropathy.
The healing of pressure ulcers may be slowed by the age of the व्यक्ति, medical शर्तें ( such as arteriosclerosis, diabetes or infection ), smoking or medications such as antiinflammatory drugs.
Although often prevented and treatable if found early, दबाव ulcers can be बहुत difficult to prevent in critically ill patients, frail elders, wheelchair users ( especially where spinal injury is involved ) and terminally ill patients.
Primary prevention is to redistribute pressure by turning the रोगी regularly.
The benefit of turning to avoid further sores is well documented since at least the 19th century.
In addition to turning and re-positioning the patient in bed or wheelchair, eating a balanced diet साथ adequate protein and keeping the skin free from exposure to urine and stool is very महत्वपूर्ण.
The prevalence of दबाव ulcers in hospital settings is high, but improvements are being made.
According to the 2010 IPUP ( International Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Survey ) conducted in Canada, there was a significant decrease in the overall facility-acquired prevalence of pressure ulcers from 2009-2010.
Ulcers were most commonly identified at the sacral/coccyx ulcer location ; however, heel छाले were the most common facility-acquired location in the survey.

The conducting मण्डल warms the air to and humidifies the air.
It also cleanses the air by removing particles via cilia located on the दीवारें of all the passageways.
The lungs are घिरी by the rib cage.
The respiratory zone is the site of gas exchange with blood.
The sympathetic nervous system via noradrenaline acting on the beta receptors causes bronchodilation.
The parasympathetic बेचैन system via acetylcholine, which acts on the M-3 muscarinic receptors, maintains the resting tone of the bronchiolar smooth muscle.
This कार्रवाई is related, although considered distinct from bronchoconstriction.
Many अन्य non-autonomic nervous and biochemical stimuli, including कार्बन डाइऑक्साइड and oxygen, are also involved in the regulation process.
The pleural cavity is the potential स्पेस between the parietal pleura, lining the inner wall of the thoracic cage, and the visceral pleura lining the lungs.

the baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is one of the body 's homeostatic mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure.
It provides a ऋणात्मक feedback loop in जिससे an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes heart रेट to decrease इसलिए causing blood pressure to decrease ; likewise, decreased blood pressure activates the baroreflex, causing heart rate to increase यूँ causing an increase in blood pressure.
The system relies on specialized neurons, known as baroreceptors, in the aortic arch, carotid sinuses, and elsewhere to monitor changes in blood pressure and relay them to the brainstem.
Subsequent परिवर्तन in blood pressure are mediated by the autonomic nervous system.

Pawn in the standard Staunton pattern
the pawn ( ♙♟ ) is the most numerous and in most circumstances the weakest piece in the game of chess, historically representing infantry or, अधिक particularly, armed peasants or pikemen.
In chess, each player begins the game with eight pawns, one on each वर्गाकार of the रैंक immediately in front of the other pieces.
( In algebraic notation, the white pawns प्रारंभ on a2, b2, c2,..., h2, while black pawns start on a7, b7, c7,..., h7. )
Individual pawns are referred to by the file on which they stand.
For example, one बोलती of `` White 's f-pawn '' or `` Black 's b-pawn '', or less commonly ( using descriptive संकेतन ), `` White 's king 's बिशप pawn '' or `` Black 's queen 's knight pawn ''.
It is also common to refer to a rook pawn, meaning any pawn on the a- or h-file, a knight pawn ( on the b- or g-file ), a bishop pawn ( on the c- or f-file ), a queen pawn ( on the d-file ), a king pawn ( on the e-file ), and a सेंट्रल pawn ( on either the d- or e-file ).
The military forces of the world have differing approaches to the enlistment of homosexual ( gay and lesbian ) and bisexual individuals.
The armed forces of most developed countries have now removed नीतियों excluding non-heterosexual individuals ( with strict policies on यौन harassment ).

Hydrogen production is the family of औद्योगिक methods for generating hydrogen.
फिलहाल the dominant technology लिये direct production is steam reforming from hydrocarbons.
Many other methods are known including electrolysis and thermolysis.
In 2006, the संयुक्त States was estimated to have a production capacity of 11 million tonnes of hydrogen.
5 million tonnes of hydrogen were consumed on-site in oil refining, and in the production of ammonia ( Haber process ) और methanol ( reduction of carbon monoxide ).
0.4 million tonnes were an incidental by-product of the chlor-alkali process.
Hydrogen production is an estimated $ 100 billion industry.
A basis point ( often denoted as bp, colloquially referred to in the plural as `` bips '', also known as a `` beep '' ) is a unit equal to one hundredth of a percentage point, or one part per ten thousand, 1/10000.
the same unit is also ( rarely ) called a permyriad, literally meaning 'for ( every ) myriad ( ten thousand ) ', and in that context is written साथ which looks like a percent sign ( % ) with two अतिरिक्त zeroes at the end ( like a stylized form of the four zeros in the denominator, although it originates as a natural extension of the percent ( % ) and permille ( ‰ ) signs ).
a basis पाइंट is defined as:
1 basis पाइंट = 1 permyriad = one one-hundredth percent
1 bp = 1 = 0.01 % = 0.1‰ = 10−4 = = 0.0001
1 % = 100 bp = 100
Basis अंक are used as a convenient unit of मापन in contexts where percentage मतभेद of कम than 1 % are discussed.
The most common उदाहरण is interest rates, where differences in interest rates of कम than 1 % per year are usually सार्थक to बात about.
For example, a difference of 0.10 percentage points is equivalent to a change of 10 basis points ( e.g. a 4.67 % rate increases by 10 आधार points to 4.77 % ).
Like प्रतिशत points, basis points avoid the ambiguity between relative and absolute discussions about interest rates by dealing तभी with the absolute change in numeric value of a rate.
For example, if a report says there has been a `` 1 % increase '' from a 10 % interest rate, this could refer to an increase either from 10 % to 10.1 % ( relative, 1 % of 10 % ), or from 10 % to 11 % ( absolute, 1 % plus 10 % ).
If, however, the report says there has been a `` 10 basis point increase '' from a 10 % interest rate, then we know that the ब्याज rate of 10 % has increased by 0.10 % ( the निरपेक्ष change ) to a 10.1 % rate.
It is common practice in the वित्तीय industry to use basis points to denote a rate change in a financial instrument, or the difference ( स्प्रेड ) between two interest rates, सहित the yields of fixed-income securities.
Since certain loans and bonds may commonly be quoted in relation to some index or underlying security, वे will often be quoted as a spread over ( or under ) the index.
For example, a loan that bears interest of 0.50 % per annum above the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) is said to be 50 basis अंक over LIBOR, which is commonly expressed as `` L+50bps '' or simply `` L+50 ''.
The term `` basis पाइंट '' has its origins in trading the `` basis '' or the spread between two interest rates.
Since the basis is usually small, these are quoted multiplied up by 10000, and hence a `` full point '' movement in the `` basis '' is a basis point.
Contrast with pips in FX forward markets.
The relationship between percentage परिवर्तन and basis points can be summarized as follows : 1 percentage point change = 100 basis points, and 0.01 percentage points = 1 basis point.
So, a bond whose yield increases from 5 % to 5.5 % is said to increase by 50 basis points ; or interest rates that have risen 1 percentage पाइंट are said to have increased by 100 basis points.
The British Royal Family is the group of close relatives of the monarch of the United Kingdom.

Today, they often perform ceremonial and social duties throughout the संयुक्त Kingdom and abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom.

A Motorola Advisor alphanumeric pager प्रयुक्त in ब्राज़ील in the 1990s, operated by Teletrim
A pager is a wireless दूरसंचार device that receives and displays numeric or text messages, or receives and announces voice messages.
one-way pagers can only receive संदेश, जबकि response pagers and two-way pagers can also acknowledge, reply to, and originate messages using an internal ट्रांसमीटर.
Pagers operate as part of a paging प्रणाली जिससे includes one or अधिक fixed transmitters ( or in the case of response pagers and two-way pagers, one or more base stations ), as well as a number of pagers carried by mobile users.
These systems can range from a restaurant system with a single low-power transmitter, to a देशभर system साथ thousands of high-power base स्टेशन.
One of the first practical paging सेवाएं was शुभारम्भ in 1950 for physicians in the New यॉर्क City area.
Physicians paid US $ 12 प्रति माह for the service और carried a ( 6 oz ) pager that would receive phone messages within ( 25 mi ) of a सिंगल transmitter मीनार.
The system was manufactured by the Reevesound Company और operated by Telanswerphone.
In 1960, John फ्रांसिस Mitchell combined elements of Motorola 's Walkie Talkie and automobile रेडियो technologies to create the first transistorized pager, और from इस point, paging technology continued to advance, and pager adoption continued to expand, until the early 1990s.
However, by the mid-1990s, as cellular technologies became cheaper and more widely available, advanced services began to displace paging as a commercial product.
Today, pagers exist largely as niche products, finding preferential use in applications such as अस्पताल, public safety, and retail locations where their simplicity, high reliability, and कम cost represent significant advantages.

Cheese is produced in wide-ranging flavors, textures, and forms.
Cheese consists of proteins and मोटे from मिल्क, usually the मिल्क of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep.
It is produced by coagulation of the milk protein casein.
Typically, the milk is acidified and addition of the enzyme rennet causes coagulation.
the solids are अलग and pressed into final रूप.
Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout.
Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.
Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are उत्पादित.
Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk ( including the animal 's diet ), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging.
Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents.
The पीला to red color of many cheeses, ऐसे as Red Leicester, is normally formed from adding annatto.
For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice.
Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the जोड of rennet completes the curdling.
Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available ; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei, but others have been extracted from various प्रजाति of the Cynara thistle family.
Cheese is valued for its portability, long life, and high content of मोटे, protein, कैल्सियम, and phosphorus.

Madrid also बाँधने among the 12 greenest European cities in 2010. < ref name= '' http : //www.citymayors.com/environment/greenest-cities-europe.html '' > Madrid is currently a Candidate नगर for the 2020 Summer Olympics.
Madrid houses the headquarters of the World Tourism Organization ( WTO ), belonging to the United Nations Organization ( UN ), the segib, the Organization of Ibero-American States ( OEI ), and the Public Interest Oversight Board ( PIOB ).
It also hosts major international institutions regulators of Spanish : the Standing Committee of the Association of Spanish भाषा Academies, headquarters of the Royal Spanish Academy ( RAE ), the cervantes Institute और the Foundation of तात्कालिक Spanish ( Fundéu ).
Madrid organizes fairs as FITUR, ARCO, SIMO TCI and the Cibeles Madrid Fashion Week.
While Madrid possesses a modern infrastructure, it has preserved the look and feel of many of its historic neighbourhoods and streets.

The path of the via Appia और of the via Appia Traiana.
Remains of the Appian Way in Rome, near Quarto Miglio
Near Rome.
the Appian Way ( Latin and Italian : Via Appia ) was one of the earliest and strategically most important रोमन सड़कें of the ancient गणतंत्र.
It connected Rome to Brindisi, Apulia, in southeast Italy.
Its importance is indicated by इसके common name, recorded by Statius :
Appia teritur regina longarum viarum
`` the appian way is the queen of the long roads ''
The road is named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who began and completed the first खण्ड as a military road to the south in 312 BC दौरान the Samnite Wars.
The Draupner wave, a single दानव wave measured on New Year 's Day 1995, finally confirmed the existence of freak waves, which had previously been considered near-mythical
Rogue waves ( also known as freak waves, monster waves, कातिल waves, extreme waves, and abnormal लहरें ) are relatively large and spontaneous ocean surface waves कि occur far out at sea, and are a threat even to large ships and ocean liners.
In oceanography, वे are अधिक precisely defined as waves whose height is more than twice the significant wave height ( SWH ), which is itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record.
Therefore rogue waves are not necessarily the biggest waves found at sea ; they are, rather, surprisingly large waves for a given sea राज्य.
Rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause, but occur where physical factors such as ऊँची winds and दमदार currents cause waves to merge to create a सिंगल exceptionally large wave.
Electress Sophia of Hanover ( 1630–1714 )
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom और the other 15 Commonwealth realms.
The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics.
the British government does not publish an official list of सब those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.
At a summit in Perth, Western Australia in 2011, the heads of government of all 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to adopt absolute primogeniture, end the exclusion of people married to Roman Catholics, और make other changes in the succession rules.
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State ( and a regent if the need arises ) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.
For earlier versions of the line of succession, see History of the British line of succession.
Edward Montgomery Clift ( October 17, 1920July 23, 1966 ) was an American film and stage कर्ता The New York Times’ obituary noted his portrayal of `` moody, संवेदनशील young men ''.
He often played outsiders and `` victim-heroes '' ; examples include the social climber in George Stevens 's A Place in the Sun, the anguished Catholic priest in Hitchcock 's I कबूल, the doomed regular soldier Robert E. Lee Prewitt in Fred Zinnemann 's From Here to Eternity, and the Jewish GI bullied by antisemites in Edward Dmytryk 's The Young Lions.
Later, after a disfiguring car crash in 1956, and alcohol and prescription drug abuse, he became erratic.
nevertheless important roles were still his, including `` the reckless, alcoholic, mother-fixated rodeo performer '' in John Huston 's The Misfits, the title role in Huston 's, and the विशेषज्ञता camp victim in Stanley Kramer 's Judgment at Nuremberg. ''

The War on Terror ( also known as the Global War on आतंक ) is a term commonly applied to an international सैन्य campaign which started as a result of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States.
इस resulted in an अंतरराष्ट्रीय military campaign to eliminate al-Qaeda and other militant organizations.
The United Kingdom and many अन्य NATO and non-NATO राष्ट्र participate in the conflict.
The phrase 'War on Terror ' was first used by US President George W. Bush on 20 September 2001.
The Bush administration and the Western media have since used the term to signify a वैश्विक military, political, lawful, and conceptual struggle—targeting both organizations designated as terrorist and regimes accused of supporting them.
it was typically प्रयुक्त with a particular focus on militant islamists, al-Qaeda, and other jihadi groups.
Although the term is not officially used by the administration of US President Barack Obama ( which बजाय uses the term विदेशी Contingency Operation ), it is still commonly used by politicians, in the media and by some aspects of government officially, such as the United States ' Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.
German battleship Schleswig-Holstein, Westerplatte, September 1, 1939
Destroyer USS Shaw exploding after her forward magazine was detonated during the Attack on Pearl Harbor
the main causes of World युद्ध II were nationalistic मुद्दे, unresolved मुद्दे, and resentments resulting from World War I and the interwar period in Europe, in addition to the effects of the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The culmination of events that led to the outbreak of war are generally समझा to be the 1939 invasion of Poland by जर्मनी और Soviet Russia and the 1937 invasion of the Republic of China by the Empire of Japan.
These military aggressions were the result of decisions made by the authoritarian ruling Nazi elite in Germany and by the leadership of the Kwantung Army in Japan.
World War II started after these aggressive actions were मिले with an official declaration of war and/or armed resistance.

The Mitsubishi Galant is an automobile manufactured by Mitsubishi Motors between 1969 and 2012.
The name was derived from the French शब्द galant, meaning `` chivalrous ''.
There have been nine distinct generations, and cumulative sales अभी exceed five million.
It began as a compact sedan, but over the course of its life रै evolved into a larger mid-size car.
Initial production was only based in Japan, but since 1994 the American market has been served by vehicles assembled at the former Diamond-Star Motors ( dsm ) facility in Normal, Illinois.
Blood pressure ( bp ), sometimes referred to as arterial blood pressure, is the pressure exerted by circulating blood upon the walls of blood बरतन, and is one of the principal vital signs.
When used without further specification, `` blood pressure '' usually refers to the arterial pressure of the प्रणालीगत circulation.
During each heartbeat, blood pressure varies between a maximum ( systolic ) and a minimum ( diastolic ) pressure.
The blood pressure in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart.
Differences in mean रक्त pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation.
The rate of औसत रक्त flow depends on the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels.
Mean blood दबाव decreases as the circulating blood moves away from the heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy.
Mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation, although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles.
Gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces ( e.g., during standing ) और valves in veins, श्वास, and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence blood pressure in veins.
Blood दबाव without further specification usually refers to the systemic arterial दबाव measured at a person 's upper arm and is a measure of the pressure in the brachial artery, the major धमनी in the upper arm.
A person’s blood pressure is प्रायः expressed in terms of the systolic दबाव over diastolic pressure and is measured in millimetres of पारा ( mmHg ), for example 120/80.
A veto – Latin for `` I forbid '' – is the power ( used by an officer of the राज्य, लिये example ) to unilaterally stop an आधिकारिक action, especially the enactment of legislation.
A veto can be absolute, as for instance in the United Nations Security Council, whose permanent members ( China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States of America ) can ब्लाक any resolution.
Or it can be limited, as in the legislative process of the United States, where a two-thirds vote in both the House और Senate may override a Presidential veto of legislation.
A veto only gives power to stop changes, not to adopt उन्हें ( मगर for the rare `` amendatory veto '' ).
Thus a veto allows its holder to protect the status quo.
The अवधारणा of a veto body originated with the रोमन consuls and tribunes.
Either of the two consuls holding office in a given year could block a military or civil decision by the other ; any tribune had the power to unilaterally block legislation passed by the Roman Senate.
Sulfur डाइऑक्साइड ( also sulphur डाइऑक्साइड ) is the chemical compound with the formula.
It is a toxic gas with a pungent, तकलीफदेह smell, that is released by volcanoes and in विभिन्न industrial processes.
Since coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds, उनके combustion generates sulfur dioxide unless the sulfur compounds are removed before burning the fuel.
Further oxidation of SO2, usually in the उपस्थिति of a catalyst such as NO2, forms h2so4, and thus acid rain.
Sulfur dioxide emissions are also a precursor to particulates in the atmosphere.
Both of these impacts are cause for concern over the environmental impact of these fuels.
Myasthenia gravis ( from Greek μύς `` मांसपेशी '', `` weakness '', and `` serious '' ; abbreviated mg ) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability.
It is an autoimmune विकार, in which weakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the excitatory प्रभाव of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors throughout neuromuscular junctions.
myasthenia is treated medically with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants, and, in selected cases, thymectomy.
The disease incidence is 3–30 मामले per million per year and rising as a result of increased awareness.
MG must be विशिष्ट from congenital myasthenic syndromes that can present similar symptoms but offer no response to immunosuppressive treatments.

A liquid-crystal display ( LCD ) is a चपटा panel display, electronic visual display, or video display that uses the light modulating properties of liquid crystals.
Liquid crystals do नहीं emit light directly.
LCDs are available to display arbitrary images ( as in a general-purpose computer display ) or फिक्स्ड बिंब which can be displayed or hidden, such as preset words, digits, and 7-segment displays as in a digital क्लॉक.
वे use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images are बना up of a large number of small pixels, while अन्य displays have larger elements.
LCDs are used in a wide दायरा of applications including computer monitors, televisions, instrument panels, aircraft कॉकपिट displays, and signage.
They are common in consumer devices such as video खिलाड़ी, gaming devices, clocks, watches, calculators, and telephones, and have replaced cathode ray tube ( CRT ) displays in सबसे applications.
They are available in a wider range of screen sizes than CRT and प्लाज्मा displays, and since they do not use phosphors, they do not suffer image burn-in.
LCDs are, however, susceptible to image persistence.
The LCD screen is more energy efficient और can be disposed of more सकुशल than a CRT.
Its low विद्युत power consumption enables it to be used in battery -powered electronic उपकरण.
It is an electronically modulated optical device made up of any number of segments filled with liquid crystals and arrayed in front of a light source ( backlight ) or reflector to produce images in color or मोनोक्रोम.
Liquid crystals were first खोजा in 1888.
By 2008, worldwide sales of televisions with LCD screens exceeded सालाना sales of CRT units ; the CRT became obsolete for most purposes.

A bottle of high potency B-complex vitamin supplement pills.
A vitamin ( or ) is an organic यौगिक required by an organism as a vital nutrient in limited amounts.
An organic chemical compound ( or related set of compounds ) is called a vitamin when it can not be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, और must be obtained from the diet.
Thus, the term is conditional both on the हालातों and on the particular organism.
For example, ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals, and biotin and vitamin D are required in the human आहार only in certain circumstances.
By convention, the पद vitamin includes neither अन्य essential nutrients, such as dietary minerals, essential fatty acids, or essential amino acids ( which are needed in larger amounts than vitamins ) nor the large number of other nutrients that promote health but are otherwise required less often.
Thirteen vitamins are universally पहचाना at present.
Vitamins are वर्गीकृत by their biological and chemical कार्यकलाप, not उनके structure.
Thus, each `` vitamin '' refers to a number of vitamer compounds that सब show the biological activity associated with a particular विटामिन.
Such a set of chemicals is grouped under an alphabetized vitamin `` generic descriptor '' title, such as `` vitamin A ``, जिससे includes the compounds retinal, retinol, and four known carotenoids.
Vitamers by definition are convertible to the क्रियाशील form of the vitamin in the body, and are sometimes inter-convertible to one another, as well.
Vitamins have विविध biochemical functions.
Some have hormone-like functions as regulators of mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D ), or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation ( such as कुछ forms of vitamin A ).
Others function as antioxidants ( e.g., vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C ).
The largest number of vitamins ( such as b जटिल vitamins ) function as precursors लिये enzyme cofactors, कि help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism.
In this भूमिका, vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups : लिये example, biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids.
Vitamins may also be less tightly bound to एंजाइम catalysts as coenzymes, detachable molecules that function to carry रासायनिक groups or electrons between molecules.
For example, folic acid may carry methyl, formyl, and methylene groups in the cell.
Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate प्रतिक्रियाएँ are vitamins ' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally महत्वपूर्ण.
जबतक the mid-1930s, when the first वाणिज्यिक yeast-extract विटामिन B complex और semi-synthetic vitamin C supplement tablets were sold, vitamins were obtained solely through food सेवन, and changes in diet ( which, for example, could occur during a particular growing season ) usually greatly altered the types और amounts of vitamins ingested.
however, vitamins have been produced as commodity रसायन and made widely available as inexpensive semisynthetic and synthetic-source multivitamin dietary and food supplements and additives, since the middle of the 20th century.

Islam is the predominant religion in the Middle East, in Sahel, in the Horn of Africa and उत्तरी अफ़्रीकी, और in some parts of Asia.
Large communities of Muslims are also found in China, the balkans, and Russia.
Other parts of the world host large Muslim immigrant communities ; in Western Europe, for instance, Islam is the second largest religion बाद Christianity, where it represents 6 % of the total population.
According to the Pew Research Center in 2010 there were 49 Muslim-majority countries.
around 62 % of the world 's Muslims live in South and Southeast Asia, with over 1 billion adherents.

Dubai ( ; ', ) is a city in the संयुक्त Arab Emirates, located within the emirate of the same name.
the emirate of दुबई is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf on the arabian Peninsula and is one of the seven emirates that make up the देश.
It has the largest जनसांख्यिकी in the uae ( 2,106,177 ) और the second-largest land territory by area ( 4,114 km2 ) after Abu धाबी.
Dubai और Abu Dhabi, the national capital, हैं the only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country 's legislature.
The city of Dubai is located on the emirate 's northern coastline and heads up the Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area.
Dubai is nowadays often misperceived as a country or city-state and, in some cases, the UAE as a whole has been वर्णित as 'Dubai '.
The earliest mention of Dubai is in 1095 AD, और the earliest recorded settlement in the region dates from 1799.
The Sheikhdom of Dubai was formally established in 1833 by Sheikh Maktoum bin Butti Al-Maktoum when he persuaded around 800 members of his जनजाति of the Bani Yas, living in what थी then the Second Saudi State और now part of Saudi Arabia, to follow him to the Dubai Creek by the Abu Falasa clan of the Bani Yas.
It remained under the tribe 's control when the United Kingdom assumed protection of the Sheikhdom in 1892 and joined the nascent United Arab Emirates upon independence in 1971 as the country 's second emirate.
इसके strategic geographic location made the town an important trading hub and by the beginning of the 20th century, Dubai was already an important regional port.
Today, दुबई has उभरा as a cosmopolitan metropolis that रै grown steadily to become a global city and a business and cultural hub of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf प्रदेश.
Although Dubai 's economy थी historically निर्मित on the oil industry, the अमीर 's Western-style model of business drives its अर्थव्यवस्था with the main revenues now coming from tourism, real estate, and financial services.
Dubai रै recently attracted world attention through अनेक innovative विशाल construction projects and sports events.
The नगर has become symbolic for its skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, such as the world 's tallest Burj Khalifa, in addition to ambitious development प्रोजेक्ट सहित man-made islands, hotels, and some of the largest shopping malls in the प्रदेश and the world.
इस increased attention has also highlighted मजदूर and human rights issues concerning the city 's largely दक्षिण Asian paid workforce.
Dubai 's property market experienced a major deterioration in 2008–2009 as a result of the worldwide economic downturn following the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
However, Dubai has made a steady and gradual recovery with सहायता coming from neighboring emirates.
The handful of new projects that are in the pipeline have been able to सहायता Dubai real estate make a comeback.
As of 2012, Dubai is the 22nd most expensive city in the world, and the most expensive city in the Middle ईस्ट, surpassing Israel 's Tel Aviv ( 31st ).
Dubai has also been rated as one of the best places to live in the Middle East, including by US American वैश्विक consulting firm Mercer who रेटेड the city as the best place to live in the Middle East in 2011.

This animation uses धरती विज्ञान data from a variety of sensors on NASA Earth observing satellites to measure physical oceanography parameters such as ocean currents, ocean winds, sea surface height और sea surface temperature.
An ocean ( ; the World Ocean of classical antiquity ) is a body of saline water that composes a large part of a planet 's जलमंडल.
In the context of Earth, it refers to one or all of the major divisions of the planet 's World Ocean – they are, in descending order of area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern ( Antarctic ), and आर्कटिक Oceans.
The word `` sea `` is often used interchangeably with `` ocean '', but strictly speaking a sea is a देह of saline जल ( possibly a प्रभाग of the संसार Ocean ) partly or fully enclosed by land.
Earth is the only planet known to have an समंदर ( or कोई large amounts of open liquid water ).
Approximately 72 % of the planet 's surface ( ~3.6x108 km2 ) is covered by saline water कि is customarily divided into several principal oceans और smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71 % of the Earth 's surface.
In terms of the hydrosphere of the Earth, the ocean contains 97 % of the Earth 's water.
Oceanographers have stated that out of 97 %, only 5 % of the ocean as a whole on Earth has been explored.
Because it is the principal component of Earth 's hydrosphere, the world ocean is integral to all known life, forms part of the carbon cycle, and influences climate and weather patterns.
The total volume is approximately 1.3 billion cubic kilometres ( 310 million cu mi ) with an औसत depth of.
It is the आवास of 230,000 known species, हालांकि much of the ocean 's depths remain unexplored and it is estimated that over two million marine प्रजाति exist.
The origin of Earth 's oceans is still unknown, but oceans are believed to have formed in the Hadean period और may have been the impetus for the emergence of life.
Extraterrestrial oceans may be रचित of a wide range of elements and यौगिकों.
The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of टाइटन, although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the सौर System.
Early in their geologic histories, Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water महासागर.
The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a तीसरा of the सतह of Mars was once covered by water, though the water on Mars is no longer oceanic, and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled दूर the global ocean of Venus.
Compounds such as salts and अमोनिया dissolved in जल lower इसके freezing पाइंट, so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice.
Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many बौना planets and natural satellites ; notably, the ocean of Europa is believed to have over twice the water volume of धरती.
The Solar प्रणाली 's gas giant planets are also believed to possess liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be पुष्टि compositions.
Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons, सहित surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone.
Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of ग्रह with a surface completely covered with liquid.
Elvis Aaron Presley ( January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977 ) was an अमरीकी singer and actor.
a cultural icon, he is commonly known by the single name Elvis.
One of the most लोकप्रिय musicians of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the `` किंग of Rock और Roll '' or `` the King ''.
born in Tupelo, Mississippi, प्रेस्ली moved to Memphis, Tennessee, साथ his family at the age of 13.
He began his करियर there in 1954, working साथ सूर्य Records owner Sam Phillips, who wanted to लाओ the sound of African-American music to a wider audience.
Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill ब्लैक, Presley was the most important popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat -driven fusion of country and rhythm and blues.
RCA Victor acquired his contract in a सौदे arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who went on to manage the singer for over two decades.
Presley 's first RCA single, `` Heartbreak Hotel ``, released in January 1956, was a number-one hit.
He became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of चट्टान and roll with a series of network television appearances and chart-topping records.
His energized interpretations of songs, अनेक from African-American sources, and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular—and विवादास्पद.
in November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender.
Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years बाद with some of his most commercially successful work.
He staged few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided.
In 1968, after seven years away from the stage, he returned to live performance in a celebrated comeback television special that led to an विस्तारित Las वेगास concert residency and a string of profitable tours.
in 1973 Presley मंचन the first concert broadcast globally via उपग्रह, Aloha from हवाई.
Prescription drug abuse severely deteriorated his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at the age of 42.
Presley is regarded as one of the most important figures of 20th-century popular culture.
He had a versatile voice and unusually wide success encompassing many genres, including देश, pop ballads, gospel, and blues.

A glass of root beer with foam
Root beer is a carbonated, sweetened beverage, originally बना using the root of a sassafras plant ( or the छाल of a sassafras tree ) as the primary flavor.
Root beer, popularized in North America, comes in two forms : alcoholic and soft drink.
The historical root beer was analogous to small beer in that the process provided a drink with a very low alcohol content.
Although roots are used as the source of many soft drinks throughout the world, often different names are used.
Fluorescent minerals emit दृश्य light when उजागर to पराबैंगनी light
Fluorescence is the उत्सर्जन of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic विकिरण.
it is a form of luminescence.
In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation.
However, when the absorbed electromagnetic radiation is intense, it is संभावित for one electron to absorb two photons ; इस two-photon absorption can lead to emission of radiation having a shorter wavelength than the absorbed radiation.
The emitted radiation may also be of the same wavelength as the absorbed radiation, termed `` resonance fluorescence ''.
The most striking examples of fluorescence occur when the absorbed radiation is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, and thus invisible to the human eye, and the emitted light is in the visible region.
प्रतिदीप्ति has many practical applications, including mineralogy, gemology, chemical sensors ( प्रतिदीप्ति spectroscopy ), fluorescent labelling, dyes, biological detectors, and, most commonly, fluorescent दीये.
Informal logic, intuitively, refers to the principles of logic and logical विचार outside of a formal setting.
however, शायद because of the informal in the title, the precise definition of informal logic is a matter of some dispute.
Ralph H. Johnson and J. Anthony ब्लेयर define अनौपचारिक logic as `` a branch of logic whose task is to develop non-formal standards, criteria, प्रक्रियाओं लिये the analysis, interpretation, evaluation, criticism and construction of argumentation. ''
इस definition reflects what had been implicit in their practice and what others were doing in their informal logic texts.
अनौपचारिक logic is associated with ( informal ) fallacies, critical thinking, the Thinking Skills Movement and the interdisciplinary पूछताछ known as argumentation theory.
Frans H. van Eemeren writes that the label `` informal logic '' covers a `` collection of normative approaches to the study of reasoning in ordinary language that remain closer to the अभ्यास of argumentation than औपचारिक logic. ''
USA annual real GDP 1910–60, with the years of the Great Depression ( 1929–1939 ) highlighted.
Unemployment rate in the US 1910–1960, with the years of the Great Depression ( 1929–1939 ) highlighted.
The Great Depression began in August of 1929, when the United States economy first went into an economic मंदी.
Although the country spent two महीने with declining GDP, it was नहीं until the Wall Street Crash of October, 1929 that the effects of a declining economy यहूद लगा, and a major worldwide economic downturn ensued.
The market crash marked the beginning of a decade of high unemployment, गरीबी, low profits, deflation, plunging फार्म incomes, and lost opportunities for economic growth and personal advancement.
Although इसके causes are स्टिल uncertain and controversial, the net effect was a sudden and general loss of confidence in the economic भविष्य.
The usual explanations include numerous factors, especially high consumer debt, ill-regulated markets that permitted overoptimistic loans by banks and investors, and the lack of high-growth new industries, all interacting to create a downward economic spiral of reduced spending, falling confidence, and lowered production.
Industries that suffered the most included construction, agriculture as dust-bowl शर्तें persisted in the agricultural heartland, shipping, mining, और लॉगिंग as well as durable goods like automobiles और appliances that could be postponed.
The economy पहुँचे bottom in the winter of 1932–33 ; then came four years of very rapid growth until 1937, when the Recession of 1937 brought वापस 1934 levels of unemployment.
The Depression caused major political परिवर्तन in America.
Three years into the depression, Herbert Hoover lost the 1932 presidential election to फ्रैंकलिन Delano Roosevelt in a sweeping landslide.
Roosevelt 's economic रिकवरी plan, the New Deal, instituted unprecedented कार्यक्रम for relief, recovery and reform, and brought about a major realignment of American politics.
The Depression also resulted in an increase of emigration of people to अन्य countries for the first time in American history.
For example, कुछ immigrants went back to their native countries, and some native US citizens went to Canada, Australia, and South Africa.
It also resulted in the mass migration of people from badly hit areas in the Great Plains and the South to places such as California and the North, respectively ( see Okies and the Great Migration of African Americans ).
Racial tensions also increased during this समय.
By the 1940s immigration had लौटे back to normal, and emigration declined.
A well-known example of an emigrant was Frank McCourt, who went to Ireland, as recounted in his book एंजेला 's Ashes.
The memory of the Depression also shaped modern theories of economics and resulted in many changes in how the government dealt with आर्थिक downturns, such as the use of stimulus packages, Keynesian economics, और Social Security.
It also shaped modern American साहित्य, resulting in famous novels such as John Steinbeck 's `` The Grapes of प्रकोप `` and `` Of Mice and Men ``.
The Great Depression of the 1930s started with the stock market crash of October 1929.

The area now called तुर्कों has been inhabited since the Paleolithic, including various Ancient Anatolian civilizations और Thracian peoples.
After Alexander the Great 's conquest, the क्षेत्रफल was Hellenized, which continued with the Roman rule and the transition into the Byzantine Empire.
the Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century, starting the process of turkification, which was greatly accelerated by the सलजूक़ victory over the Byzantines at the बैटल of manzikert in 1071.
The Seljuk Sultanate of rûm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, upon which it disintegrated into several small Turkish beyliks.
Starting from the late 13th सदी, the Ottoman beylik united Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia and North Africa.

Lent celebrants carrying out a street procession during Holy Week.
The बैंगनी color is प्रायः associated with penance and detachment.
Similar Christian penitential practice is seen in other कैथोलिक countries, sometimes associated with mortification of the flesh.
granada, Nicaragua.
lent ( Latin : Quadragesima ) is a solemn observance in the liturgical year of many Christian denominations, lasting लिये a काल of approximately six weeks leading up to Easter Sunday.
In the general Latin-rite and most Western denominations Lent is taken to run इससे Ash Wednesday to maundy Thursday ( Holy Thursday ) morning or to Easter Eve.
In the Catholic Church, Lent lasts until Holy Thursday, while other denominations run until Easter Eve.
The traditional purpose of Lent is the preparation of the आस्तिक through prayer, penance, repentance, almsgiving, and self-denial.
Its institutional purpose is heightened in the annual commemoration of Holy Week, marking the death, burial and क़यामत of Jesus, which recalls the events of the Bible when Jesus is crucified on Good Friday, which then culminates in the celebration on Easter Sunday of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.
During Lent, many of the faithful commit to fasting or giving up certain types of luxuries as a form of penitence.
The Stations of the Cross, a devotional commemoration of Christ 's carrying the Cross and of his execution, are often observed.
Many Roman Catholic and some Protestant churches remove flowers from their altars, while crucifixes, religious statues, और other elaborate religious symbols are often veiled in violet fabrics in solemn observance of the event.
In certain pious कैथोलिक देशों, कुछ adherents mark the season with the परंपरागत abstention from the consumption of meat.
In some countries, grand religious processions and cultural customs are observed, and the faithful attempt to visit seven churches दौरान Holy Week in honor of Jesus मसीह heading to Mount Calvary.
lent is traditionally described as lasting for forty days, in commemoration of the forty days which, according to the Gospels of मैथ्यू, Mark और Luke, यीशु spent fasting in the मरुस्थल पहले the beginning of his public ministry, where he endured temptation by the Devil.
However, different Christian denominations calculate the forty दिनों of Lent differently.
In most Western traditions the Sundays are not counted as part of Lent ; thus the period from Ash Wednesday until Easter consists of 40 days when the Sundays are excluded.
However in the Roman Catholic Church Lent is now taken to end on Holy Thursday बल्कि than Easter Eve, and hence lasts 38 days excluding Sundays, or 44 days in total.
This event, along with its pious customs are observed by catholics, lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Anglicans.

The Chernobyl disaster (, Chornobylska Katastrofa – Chornobyl Catastrophe ) was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on 26 अप्रैल 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear शक्ति Plant in Ukraine ( then officially the Ukrainian SSR ), which was अंतर्गत the सीधा jurisdiction of the सेंट्रल authorities of the Soviet Union.
An explosion and fire released विशाल quantities of रेडियोसक्रिय particles into the atmosphere, which spread over much of the western ussr and Europe.
The Chernobyl disaster is widely considered to have been the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, and is एक of only two classified as a level 7 इवेंट on the अंतरराष्ट्रीय Nuclear Event Scale ( the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 ).
The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers और cost an estimated 18 billion rubles.
The official Soviet casualty count of 31 मौतों has been disputed, and long-term effects such as cancers और deformities are still being accounted for.
In grammar, a subject complement is a predicative expression कि फ़ॉलो a linking क्रिया ( copula ) and that complements ( completes ) the subject of the sentence by either ( 1 ) renaming it or ( 2 ) describing it.
In the former case, a renaming noun phrase such as a संज्ञा or pronoun is called a predicative nominal.
an adjective following the copula और describing the subject is called a predicative adjective.
In either case the predicative complement in effect mirrors the subject.
Subject complements are used with a small class of verbs called linking verbs or copula, of which be is the most common.
चूंकि copula are stative verbs, subject complements are not affected by any action of the क्रिया.
Subject complements are typically not clause arguments, nor are they clause adjuncts.

Antoine Lavoisier 's discovery of the Law of Conservation of Mass led to many new findings in the 19th सदी.
Joseph proust 's law of definite proportions and John Dalton 's atomic theory branched from the discoveries of Antoine Lavoisier.
Lavoisier 's quantitative experiments revealed that combustion involved ऑक्सीजन rather than what was previously thought to be phlogiston.
the law of संरक्षण of mass, or principle of mass conservation, states कि for any प्रणाली closed to all transfers of matter और energy ( both of which have mass ), the द्रव्यमान of the system must remain निरंतर over time, as system mass can not change quantity if it is not added or removed.
Hence, the मात्रा of mass is `` conserved '' over time.
The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in form, as for example when light or physical work is transformed into particles that contribute the same mass to the system as the light or work had contributed.
The law implies ( requires ) that during any chemical reaction, nuclear reaction, or radioactive decay in an isolated system, the mass of the reactants or starting material must equal the mass of the उत्पाद.
The concept of mass conservation is widely used in अनेक fields such as chemistry, mechanics, and fluid dynamics.
Historically, mass conservation was discovered in chemical reactions by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century, and was of crucial importance in the प्रगति from alchemy to the आधुनिक प्राकृतिक science of chemistry.
The closely related concept of matter conservation was found to hold good in chemistry to such high approximation that it failed only for the high energies treated by the later refinements of relativity theory, लकिन otherwise remains useful and sufficiently accurate लिये most chemical calculations, even in modern practice.
In special relativity, needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems is शामिल, the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes important, since conservation of mass is strictly and perfectly upheld only for so-called isolated systems, i.e. those completely isolated from all exchanges साथ the environment.
In this circumstance, the mass-energy equivalence theorem states that mass conservation is equivalent to total energy conservation, which is the first law of thermodynamics.
By कंट्रास्ट, for a thermodynamically closed system ( i.e., one which is closed to exchanges of matter, but खोलें to exchanges of non-material energy, such as heat and work, with the surroundings ) mass is ( प्रायः ) तभी approximately conserved.
The input or output of non-material energy must change the mass of the system in relativity theory, although the change is usually small, since relatively large amounts of such energy ( by comparison with ordinary experience ) carry only a small amount of mass ( again by ordinary standards of measurement ).
In special relativity, mass is not converted to energy, since energy in all of its forms always retains its equivalent amount of mass throughout any transformation or translocation into, or out of, a प्रणाली.
However, certain types of matter ( a different concept ) may be converted to energy, so long as the mass of the system is unchanged in the process.
However, if such energy is removed from systems, they must lose the mass कि is associated with it.
in general relativity, mass ( and energy ) conservation in expanding volumes of space is a complex अवधारणा, subject to different definitions, and neither द्रव्यमान nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity and in Minkowski space.
For a discussion, see mass in general relativity.

A floppy disk, or diskette, is a डिस्क storage medium रचित of a disk of thin and flexible magnetic storage medium, sealed in a rectangular plastic carrier lined with fabric that removes dust particles.
They are पढ़ा and written by a फ्लॉपी disk drive ( FDD ).
Floppy disks, initially as media and later in and 3.5-inch ( 90 mm ) sizes, were a ubiquitous form of data storage and एक्सचेंज from the mid-1970s well into the first decade of the 21st century.
By 2010, कंप्यूटर motherboards यहूद rarely manufactured with फ्लॉपी drive support ; `` floppies could be used as an external USB drive, but ``, 8 ``, and non-standard drives could only be handled by old उपकरण.
While floppy disk drives still have some limited uses, especially with legacy औद्योगिक computer equipment, they have been superseded by data भंडार methods with much greater capacity, such as USB flash drives, portable external hard disk drives, optical discs, memory cards, and computer networks.
An animated diagram of a cutter
In baseball, a cutter, or cut fastball, is a type of fastball which breaks slightly toward the pitcher 's glove पक्ष as it reaches home plate.
This pitch is somewhere between a slider and a fastball, as it is usually thrown faster than a slider but with more motion than a typical fastball.
Some pitchers use a cutter as a way to prevent hitters from expecting their regular fastballs.
A common technique used to throw a cutter is to उपयोग a four-seam fastball grip with the बेसबॉल set slightly off center in the hand.
When a batter is able to hit a cutter pitch, it often results in soft contact and an आसान out, due to the pitch 's गति keeping the ball away from the bat 's sweet spot.
The cutter is typically 2–5 mph slower than a pitcher 's four-seam fastball.
In 2010, the average pitch classified as a cutter by PITCHf/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6 किमी ; the average four-seamer was 92.1 mph.

The humanities are academic disciplines कि study human culture, using methods that हैं primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, and having a significant historical element, as distinguished from the मुख्यतः empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
The humanities include ancient and आधुनिक languages, literature, philosophy, religion, and visual and performing arts such as music and theatre.
The मानवता that हैं also regarded as social sciences include history, anthropology, क्षेत्रफल अध्ययन, communication studies, cultural studies, law, economics and linguistics.
Scholars working in the humanities are sometimes described as `` humanists ''.
However, that term also describes the philosophical position of humanism, which some `` antihumanist `` scholars in the humanities reject.
Some secondary schools offer humanities classes, usually consisting of English literature, global studies, और art.
Human disciplines like history, cultural anthropology and psychoanalysis study subject matters to which the experimental method does नहीं apply, and they have access instead to the comparative method and comparative research.
The 2005 Blue Room Christmas Tree
The White House क्रिसमस Tree, also known as the Blue Room Christmas पेड़, is the official indoor Christmas tree at the residence of the President of the United States, the White House.
The first indoor Christmas पेड़ was installed in the White House sometime in the 19th century ( there are varying claims as to the exact year ) and since 1961 the tree has had a themed motif at the discretion of the First महिला of the United States.
The President of the United राज्य of America ( POTUS ) is the head of state and head of government of the United States.
The president leads the executive शाखा of the संघीय government and is the commander-in-chief of the संयुक्त States Armed Forces.
Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests the executive power of the United States in the अध्यक्ष और charges him with the निष्पादन of federal law, alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, और judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers, with the advice और consent of the Senate.
The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of कॉंग्रेस under extraordinary circumstances.
चूंकि the founding of the संयुक्त States, the power of the अध्यक्ष and the federal government have grown substantially and each modern president, despite possessing no formal विधान powers beyond signing or vetoing congressionally passed bills, is largely responsible for dictating the legislative agenda of his पार्टी and the foreign and domestic policy of the United States.
The अध्यक्ष is frequently described as the सबसे powerful person in the world.
The president is indirectly elected by the लोगों through the Electoral College to a four-year पद, and is one of only दो nationally निर्वाचित संघीय officers, the other being the Vice President of the United States.
The Twenty-second Amendment, adopted in 1951, prohibits anyone from ever होने elected to the presidency for a third पूरा term.
It also prohibits a person from being elected to the presidency अधिक than once if that person previously had served as president, or acting अध्यक्ष, for more than two years of another person 's term as president.
In all, 43 individuals have served 55 four-year terms.
On January 20, 2009, Barack Obama became the 44th and current president.
On November 6, 2012, he was re-elected and is scheduled to serve until January 20, 2017.
Senses are physiological capacities of organisms that provide data for perception.
The senses and their operation, वर्गीकरण, and theory are overlapping topics studied by a variety of fields, most notably neuroscience, cognitive मनोविज्ञान ( or cognitive science ), and philosophy of perception.
The nervous system has a specific sensory system or organ, dedicated to each sense.
Humans have a multitude of senses.
Sight ( ophthalmoception ), hearing ( audioception ), taste ( gustaoception ), smell ( olfacoception or olfacception ), and touch ( tactioception ) are the five traditionally recognized.
While the ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by the traditional senses exists, including temperature ( thermoception ), kinesthetic sense ( proprioception ), pain ( nociception ), balance ( equilibrioception ), acceleration ( kinesthesioception ), and various internal stimuli ( e.g. the different chemoreceptors for detecting salt and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood ), only a small number of these can safely be classified as separate senses in and of themselves.
What constitutes a sense is a matter of some debate, leading to difficulties in defining what exactly a sense is.
पशु भी have receptors to sense the world around them, with degrees of capability varying greatly between species.
Humans have a comparatively weak भाव of smell, while some animals may lack one or more of the traditional five senses.
Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory stimuli in very different ways.
Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that इंसानो can not, with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic fields, and detect water pressure और currents.
Spiders ( order Araneae ) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight टाँगे और chelicerae with fangs that inject venom.
They हैं the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all अन्य groups of organisms.
Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exception of air and sea colonization.
As of 2008, at least 43,678 spider species, and 109 families have been recorded by taxonomists ; however, there has been confusion within the वैज्ञानिक community as to how सब these परिवारों should be classified, as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900.
Anatomically, spiders differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel.
Unlike insects, spiders do नहीं have antennae.
In all except the most आदिम group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into एक द्रव्यमान in the cephalothorax.
Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.
Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen.
Spider webs vary widely in size, shape and the amount of sticky thread used.
It अभी appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms, और spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant और diverse than orb-web spiders.
spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about, but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets.
True spiders have महरूम found in Carboniferous rocks from, and are very similar to the most primitive surviving order, the Mesothelae.
The प्रमुख groups of modern spiders, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae, first appeared in the Triassic period, before.
A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was described in 2008, but all other ज्ञात species are परभक्षी, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species भी take birds and lizards.
Spiders उपयोग a wide range of strategies to capture prey : trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down.
Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones.
मकड़ियों ' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they liquidize their खाना by flooding it with digestive enzymes and grinding it with the bases of उनके pedipalps, as they do not have true jaws.
Male spiders identify themselves by a variety of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females.
Males of सबसे species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short life spans.
महिलाओं weave रेशा egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs.
Females of many species care for their young, लिये example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them.
A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may हाउस anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals.
Social बर्ताव ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, to co-operative hunting and food-sharing.
हालांकि most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and अन्य mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity.
While the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides.
Spider रेशा provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, और spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals और plants to see if these can be used as silk factories.
As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers.
Grey 's Anatomy is an American television medical drama that premiered on the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ), as a mid-season replacement on March 27, 2005.
The series रै aired nine seasons, and focuses on the fictional lives of surgical interns and निवासियों as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, while trying to maintain personal lives.
The show 's premise originated साथ Shonda Rhimes, जो serves as an executive producer, along with Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, and Allan Heinberg.
The series was created to be racially diverse, utilizing a color-blind casting technique.
It is primarily फिल्माया in Los एंजिल्स, California.
The series ' protagonist is Dr. मेरेडिथ Grey ( एलेन pompeo ), who originally is accepted into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital.
Meredith is assigned to work under Dr. Miranda बेली ( Chandra Wilson ), along with Dr. Cristina Yang ( Sandra Oh ), Dr. George O'Malley ( T. R. Knight ), Dr. Izzie Stevens ( Katherine Heigl ), and Dr. Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ).
Following o'malley 's मौत and Stevens ' departure, the hospital 's merger साथ Mercy West brings in Dr. Jackson Avery ( Jesse विलियम्स ) and dr. April Kepner ( Sarah Drew ), in the sixth season.
The surgical wing is primarily supervised by dr. Richard webber ( James Pickens, Jr. ), who is आखिरकार replaced by Dr. Derek Shepherd ( Patrick Dempsey ), और later Dr. Owen Hunt ( केविन McKidd ).
Dr. Preston Burke ( Isaiah Washington ) departs at the conclusion of the third season, and is replaced by Dr. एरिका Hahn ( ब्रुक Smith ), who पत्ते the show during the fifth season, and later dr. Teddy Altman ( Kim Raver ), who प्रस्थान at the end of the eighth ऋतु.
Introduced in the second ऋतु is Dr. Addison Montgomery ( Kate वाल्श ), who पत्ते the दिखाएँ at the end of the third season, in order to launch her own spin-off medical drama Private Practice.
Dr. Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ) and Dr. Mark Sloan ( Eric Dane ) also enter the दिखाएँ in the second season, while the latter dies in the premiere of the ninth season.
Meredith 's half-sister, Dr. Lexie Grey ( Chyler Leigh ), appears from season three and dies at the end of season आठ.
dr. Arizona Robbins ( Jessica Capshaw ) is given series regular औकात at the beginning of the छठे season.
Grey 's Anatomy is the highest-rated drama in the key 18–49 demographic.
Previously among the overall top-ten rated shows in the United States, Grey 's Anatomy has been well received by critics.
Considered an impact on culture, the series has प्राप्त numerous awards, और has also महरूम included in various critics ' top ten lists.
The show रै produced several specials, as well as distributed all सीज़न to DVD, and released a collection of merchandise.
In 2012, Grey 's Anatomy was नामित the fifth-highest revenue earning show, in terms of advertising per half-hour.
On May 11, 2012, the series was renewed लिये a ninth ऋतु, which premiered on September 27, 2012.
Schizophrenia ( or ) is a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by a deficit of typical emotional responses.
आम symptoms include auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and सोच, और it is accompanied by significant सोशल or occupational dysfunction.
The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3–0.7 %.
Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the patient 's reported experiences.
Genetics, early environment, neurobiology, and psychological and social processes appear to be important contributory factors ; कुछ recreational and prescription दवाएँ appear to cause or worsen symptoms.
Current शोध is केन्द्रित on the role of neurobiology, although no single isolated organic cause has been found.
The many possible combinations of symptoms have triggered debate about whether the diagnosis represents a single disorder or a number of discrete syndromes.
Despite the etymology of the term from the Greek roots skhizein ( σχίζειν, `` to split '' ) and phrēn, phren- ( φρήν, φρεν- ; `` mind '' ), schizophrenia does नहीं imply a `` split personality '', or `` multiple personality disorder '' ( which is known ये days as dissociative identity disorder ) —a condition साथ which it is often उलझन in public perception.
Rather, the term means a `` splitting of mental functions '', because of the symptomatic presentation of the illness.
The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, which primarily suppresses dopamine ( and sometimes serotonin ) receptor activity.
मनोचिकित्सा and vocational and सोशल rehabilitation are also important in treatment.
In more गंभीर cases—where there is risk to self and others— involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays हैं now shorter and less frequent than they एकबार were.
The disorder is thought mainly to affect cognition, but it also प्रायः contributes to chronic problems साथ behavior and emotion.
People with schizophrenia are likely to have additional ( comorbid ) conditions, including major depression and चिंता disorders ; the lifetime occurrence of substance use disorder is almost 50 %.
सोशल problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty, and homelessness are common.
The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is 12 to 15 years कम than those without, the result of increased physical health problems and a उच्चतर suicide rate ( about 5 % ).
Paul Leslie Snider ( April 15, 1951–August 14, 1980 ) was the estranged husband and मैनेजर of प्लेबॉय model Dorothy Stratten, whom he murdered before killing himself the same day.
The Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem from Mesopotamia, is amongst the earliest surviving works of literature.
The साहित्यिक history of Gilgamesh begins with पाँच independent Sumerian poems परिचय 'Bilgamesh ' ( Sumerian for Gilgamesh ), king of Uruk.
Four of these were used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian.
This first combined epic, known as the `` Old Babylonian '' version, dates to the 18th century BC and is titled बाद its incipit, Shūtur eli sharrī ( `` Surpassing All Other Kings '' ).
Only a few fragments of it have survived.
The बाद `` Standard Babylonian '' version dates इससे the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the incipit Sha naqba īmuru ( `` He who Saw the Deep '' ).
Fragments of approximately two thirds of this longer, twelve-tablet version have been recovered.
Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal.
The story centers on a friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu.
Enkidu is a जंगली man created by the gods as Gilgamesh 's equal to distract him from oppressing the लोगों of Uruk.
Together, वे journey to the Cedar Mountain to defeat Humbaba, its monstrous guardian.
Later they kill the Bull of Heaven, which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances.
As a punishment for these actions, the gods वाक्य Enkidu to death.
the दूसरी half of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh 's distress at Enkidu 's death, and his quest for immortality.
In order to सीख the secret of eternal life, Gilgamesh undertakes a long and perilous journey.
He learns that `` The life that you are seeking you will never find.
When the gods created man they आवंटित to him death, लकिन life they retained in their own keeping. ''
This quote was originally attributed to Siduri in the Old Babylonian version of the epic, and then attributed to the immortal flood नायिका Utnapishtim in the Akkadian version of the epic.
nevertheless, Gilgamesh 's कीर्ति lived on after his death, because of his great building प्रोजेक्ट, और उसके account of what Utnapishtim told him happened during the flood.
The story has been translated into many different languages, and Gilgamesh has since become adapted in works of popular fiction.
A eukaryote ( or ) is an organism whose cells contain complex structures enclosed within membranes.
Eukaryotes may more formally be referred to as the टैक्सोन Eukarya or Eukaryota.
The defining membrane-bound structure that sets eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells is the nucleus, or nuclear लिफाफा, within which the genetic material is carried.
The उपस्थिति of a nucleus gives eukaryotes their name, which comes from the Greek ( eu, `` good '' ) and ( karyon, `` nut '' or `` kernel '' ).
Most eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, chloroplasts and the Golgi apparatus.
All large जटिल organisms are eukaryotes, including animals, plants और fungi.
The group भी शामिल many unicellular organisms.
Cell प्रभाग in eukaryotes is different इससे कि in organisms without a nucleus ( Prokaryote ).
It involves separating the duplicated chromosomes, through movements directed by microtubules.
वहीँ are दो प्रकार of division processes.
In mitosis, one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cells.
In meiosis, जिससे is required in sexual reproduction, one द्विगुणित cell ( having two instances of each chromosome, one इससे each parent ) undergoes recombination of each जोड़ी of parental chromosomes, and तब दो stages of cell प्रभाग, resulting in four haploid cells ( gametes ).
Each gamete has just one complement of chromosomes, each a unique mix of the सम्बन्धित जोड़ी of parental chromosomes.
Eukaryota appears to be monophyletic, and so makes up one of the three domains of life.
The दो other domains, जीवाणु and Archaea, are prokaryotes and have none of the above features.
Eukaryotes represent a tiny minority of सब living things ; even in a human body there are 10 times more microbes than human cells.
However, due to their much larger size their collective worldwide बायोमास is estimated at about equal to that of prokaryotes.
They are considered to have first developed approximately 1.6–2.1 billion years ago.
The use of Internet सेवाएं or software with Internet access to defraud victims or to otherwise take advantage of them, for example by stealing personal information, जिससे can even lead to identity theft.
A very common form of Internet fraud is the distribution of rogue security software.
Internet services can be used to present fraudulent solicitations to prospective victims, to conduct fraudulent transactions, or to transmit the proceeds of fraud to financial institutions or to others connected with the scheme.
Internet fraud can occur in chat rooms, email, message boards, or on websites.
the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) is a NATO -led security mission in Afghanistan that was established by the United Nations Security Council in December 2001 by Resolution 1386, as envisaged by the Bonn Agreement.
Its main purpose is to train the Afghan National Security Forces ( ANSF ) and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding key government institutions but is also engaged in the 2001-present war with insurgent groups.
ISAF was initially charged with securing Kabul and surrounding areas इससे the Taliban, al Qaeda and factional warlords, so as to allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai.
In October 2003, the UN Security Council प्राधिकृत the expansion of the isaf मिशन throughout Afghanistan, and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the पूरे of the देश.
From 2006 to 2011, ISAF had been involved in increasingly अधिक intensive कॉम्बैट operations in southern and eastern Afghanistan.
Troop contributors include from the United States, United Kingdom, NATO member states and a number of other देशों.
The intensity of the combat faced by contributing nations varies greatly, with the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada sustaining the majority of casualties in intensive combat operations, with other contributors sustaining significantly less.
As of early 2010, there were at least 700 military bases inside Afghanistan but more were अपेक्षित to be built in the coming years.
About 400 of these were प्रयुक्त by American‐led NATO forces and 300 by ANSF.
Cocaine ( benzoylmethylecgonine ) ( INN ) is a crystalline tropane alkaloid that is obtained from the leaves of the coca plant.
The name comes from `` coca '' and the alkaloid suffix -ine, forming cocaine.
It is a stimulant, an appetite suppressant, and a topical anesthetic.
Biologically, cocaine acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor, also known as a triple reuptake inhibitor ( TRI ).
It is addictive because of its effect on the mesolimbic reward pathway.
Unlike सबसे molecules, cocaine has pockets with both high hydrophilic and lipophilic efficiency, violating the rule of hydrophilic-lipophilic balance.
This causes it to cross the blood–brain barrier far better than other psychoactive रसायन और may even induce blood-brain barrier breakdown.
It is illegal to possess, produce, or distribute cocaine for non-medicinal and non-government-sanctioned purposes in almost every country.
Whole beef tri-tip rump, roasted medium rare
The tri-tip is a cut of beef from the bottom sirloin primal cut.
It is a small triangular muscle, usually 1.5 to 2.5 पाउंड. ( 675 to 1,150g ) प्रति side of beef.
The scientific name of this muscle is tensor fasciae latae, inserted in the fascia lata, the connective tissue covering the quadriceps femoris, also called quadriceps extensor, a group of four मांसपेशियां which in turn insert in the patella, or knee cap of the animal.

The स्पीकर of the United States House of Representatives ( or Speaker of the House ) is the presiding अधिकारी of the chamber.
The office was established in 1789 by आलेख I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution, which राज्य in part, `` The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker... ''
The वर्तमान Speaker is John Boehner, a Republican who represents Ohio 's 8th congressional district.
The Constitution does not require that the Speaker be a Member of Congress, but no non-member has ever been elected to the office.
The Speaker is second in the संयुक्त States presidential line of succession, after the Vice President and ahead of the अध्यक्ष pro tempore of the U.S. सीनेट.
Unlike some Westminster system parliaments, in which the office of Speaker is माना non-partisan, in the United States the Speaker of the House is a leadership position and the office-holder actively works to set the majority पार्टी 's legislative agenda.
The Speaker usually does not personally preside over debates, instead delegating the duty to members of the House from the majority party.
Aside from duties relating to heading the House and the majority political party, the Speaker also performs प्रशासनिक and procedural functions, and represents his or her Congressional district.
A bicycle फ़्रेम is the main component of a bicycle, on to which wheels and other components are fitted.
The modern और most common frame design for an upright bicycle is based on the safety bicycle, and consists of two त्रिकोण, a main triangle and a paired पश्च triangle.
This is known as the diamond frame.
Frames are required to be strong, stiff and light, which they do by combining different materials and shapes.
`` Simple gravity pendulum '' model assumes no friction or air resistance.
An exemplar animation of a pendulum showing the गति and acceleration vectors
A लोलक is a weight suspended from a so that it can swing freely.
When a pendulum is displaced sideways इससे its resting equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity कि will accelerate it वापस toward the equilibrium position.
When released, the restoring force combined with the pendulum 's mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position, swinging back and forth.
The time for एक complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the period.
A pendulum swings with a specific period which depends ( mainly ) on इसके length.
इससे इसके discovery around 1602 by Galileo Galilei the regular गति of pendulums was used for timekeeping, and was the world 's most accurate timekeeping technology until the 1930s.
Pendulums are used to regulate pendulum clocks, and are used in scientific instruments such as accelerometers and seismometers.
Historically they यहूद used as gravimeters to measure the त्वरण of gravity in geophysical सर्वेक्षण, and even as a standard of length.
The शब्द 'pendulum ' is नई Latin, from the Latin pendulus, meaning 'hanging '.
The simple gravity pendulum is an idealized गणितीय model of a pendulum.
This is a weight ( or bob ) on the end of a massless cord suspended from a, without friction.
When given an initial push, it will swing back और forth at a constant amplitude.
Real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag, so the amplitude of their swings गिरावट.
The First Battle of सांड चलाएं, also known as First manassas ( the name used by Confederate forces ), was fought on जुलाई 21, 1861, in Prince William County, Virginia, near the नगर of manassas.
It was the first major land battle of the American Civil War.
Just महीने after the प्रारंभ of the युद्ध at Fort Sumter, the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, जिससे they expected to bring an early समाप्त to the rebellion.
yielding to political pressure, Brig. gen. irvin McDowell led उसके unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig. Gen. P. G. T. beauregard camped near Manassas जंक्शन.
McDowell 's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed by his officers and men ; nevertheless, the Confederates, who had been planning to attack the Union left flank, found themselves at an initial disadvantage.
Confederate सुदृढीकरण under Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad and the course of the battle quickly changed.
A brigade of Virginians under a relatively unknown colonel from the Virginia Military Institute, Thomas J. Jackson, stood their ground and जैक्सन प्राप्त his famous nickname, `` Stonewall जैक्सन ''.
The Confederates then launched a strong counterattack, and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire, many panicked और it turned into a rout as McDowell 's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington, D.C.
Both armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and many casualties, and realized the युद्ध was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated.

Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.
Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere.
Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.
When used without qualification, `` weather '' is understood to be the weather of Earth.
Weather is driven by एयर pressure ( temperature and moisture ) differences between one place and another.
These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics.
The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet स्ट्रीम.
Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the जेट stream flow.
Because the Earth 's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year.
On Earth 's surface, temperatures usually दायरा ±40 °C ( −40 °F to 100 °F ) annually.
Over thousands of years, changes in Earth 's orbit affect the amount and distribution of solar energy प्राप्त by the Earth and influence long-term climate and global climate change.
Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences.
Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating.
Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location.
The atmosphere is a chaotic system, so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the प्रणाली as a whole.
Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activity such as agriculture और industry has inadvertently modified weather patterns.
Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how मौसम works on Earth.
A famous लैंडमार्क in the Solar प्रणाली, Jupiter 's ग्रेट Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years.
however, weather is not limited to planetary bodies.
A star 's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very पतला atmosphere throughout the Solar System.
The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.

She signed with Capitol Records.
Perry has released three studio albums, including her debut Christian प्रयत्न Katy Hudson, One of the Boys, and Teenage Dream.
Perry 's mainstream career was kicked off with the massive chart success of her debut single `` I Kissed a Girl ``.
During her career, पेरी has been nominated लिये numerous major music awards, primarily for Teenage सपना and One of the Boys.
The following is a list of sovereign states and territories where English is an आधिकारिक language or language of सरकारी.
In 2012, there were 88 states in total ( 60 sovereign states और 28 non-sovereign states ).
In many countries English is the dominant language, but does not have official status.
In Australia, English is spoken by the vast majority of the population and is the only language used in government institutions, but Australia does not have an official language.
The case is the same in the United Kingdom and the United राज्य, though many states and regions within the U.S. do have English as an official language.
English is the dominant language of New जीलैंड और an official language of कनाडा ( along with French ), India ( along साथ Hindi and several other languages ), Ireland ( along with Irish ), and the Philippines ( along with Tagalog ).
English is the sole official language of the राष्ट्रमंडल of Nations and the Commonwealth Games.
English is one of the आधिकारिक languages of the United Nations, the European Union and the International Olympic Committee.
Many of these countries are current or former colonies or dependencies of the United Kingdom ( see also अंग्रेजों Empire ), or of the संयुक्त States, itself a former colony of the UK.
Notable exceptions include Rwanda, which was a former Belgian colony and Eritrea, which was an Italian colony where the British Empire spanned its control only in World War II and shortly after ( 1941-1952 ).
India 's linguistic picture is complex.
According to the Constitution of India, `` हिंदी in the देवनागरी script '' is the official language of the union ; and अंग्रेज़ी the 'subsidiary official language ' ; however, English is mandated for the authoritative texts of all federal laws and Supreme Court decisions and ( along with Hindi ) is one of the two languages of the Indian Parliament.
English is used almost exclusively for higher शिक्षा, business and विज्ञान.
Courses in majority of the schools are taught exclusively in English.
English is extensively used for administrative purposes in India.
India is the second-largest English-speaking देश in the world by number of speakers, after the संयुक्त States.
As such, many consider English to be the de facto official language of India.
See Official languages of India.
The linguistic makeup of Pakistan is similarly complex.
While the नेशनल language is Urdu, English is an official language and used in business, government and law.
English is a compulsory language in schools.
All school courses are taught in English.
Pakistan is the 9th largest english-speaking देश in the world by population.
Southern Cone (, ) is a भौगोलिक region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of the Tropic of मकर.
Although geographically this includes Southern and part of Southeast ( São Paulo ) of Brazil, in terms of political भूगोल the Southern cone रै traditionally comprised अर्जेंटीना, Chile, Paraguay, and उरुग्वे.
In the narrowest sense, it only covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the north by the states of Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Peru, on the west by the प्रशांत Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which it is the closest continental area of Antarctica ( 1000 km ).
High life expectancy, the highest Human Development Index of Latin America, high Standard of living, significant भागीदारी in the global markets and the उभरते economy of its members make the Southern Cone the most prosperous macro-region in South America.
For multi-event athletic competitions see Track and Field Competitions, खण्ड `` Meetings ''.
Meetings हैं sometimes held around conference tables.
In a meeting, two or more people come together to discuss one or more topics, often in a formal setting.
An आधिकारिक game in baseball, also sometimes called a regulation game, is a game that has progressed beyond the point at which it can be considered complete if necessary.
This is approximately the halfway point of the game.
In the case of inclement weather, any game which has पहुँचे this point may be रोका and shortened as needed, with the परिणाम being final, and all records and statistics counted.
a game which has not reached this point before being रोका is either considered a suspended game ( to be continued at a later date from the point of stoppage ), or is simply canceled और replayed इससे the start.
( This depends on the नियम of each individual league. )
In either case, no statistics are गिने until the game becomes आधिकारिक.
Since most professional baseball games are nine innings long, the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official game.
If the visiting team is leading, or the game is tied, the end of the पांचवां inning marks this पाइंट.
If the home team ( which bats last ) is already ahead in the score, and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning, then 41⁄2 innings ( i.e., the middle of the fifth ) is considered an official game.
the खेल is also considered official if the home team scores to take the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning, since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the नवीं.
In nearly all cases, the `` official game '' औकात is used to determine whether a बरसात check will be honored for fans holding tickets.
If a game is started but does not reach the point of becoming official, fans हैं entitled to a new ticket for the make-up game or ( in सबसे cases ) any other available game of their choice.
If a game is halted after it becomes official, the game is simply shortened and no rain check is given.
The `` official game '' statistic received some attention during the 1995 season, when Cal Ripken, Jr. was approaching the record for consecutive games played, previously आयोजित by Lou Gehrig.
Large numbers were hung on the पक्ष of the B & O Warehouse at Oriole Park at Camden Yards to show the number of games in Ripken 's streak.
Each day, a new number was unfurled during the fifth inning after each game had become official ( since the statistic would नहीं have गिने if the game had been stopped before that point ).
A similar practice has been used to count bas toward the demolition of several stadiums ( including Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia in 2003, Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis in 2005, and the original Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in New York City in 2008 ) ; as प्रत्येक game became official, the team would unveil a नई ( lower ) number showing the number of games left to be निभाई in the stadium.
A telephone number or phone number is a sequence of digits used to call from one telephone line to another in a public switched telephone संजाल.
When telephone numbers were invented, वे यहूद short — as few as one, two or three digits — and were given orally to a switchboard operator.
As phone systems have grown and interconnected to encompass the world, telephone numbers have become longer.
In addition to telephones, they now access अन्य devices, ऐसे as computers and फैक्स machines.
The number contains the information necessary to identify uniquely the intended endpoint for the telephone call.
Each such endpoint must have a unique number within the public switched टेलीफोन संजाल.
Most countries use fixed length numbers ( लिये normal lines at least ) and इसलिए the number of endpoints determines the necessary length of the telephone number.
It is also possible for प्रत्येक subscriber to have a set of shorter numbers for the endpoints most often used.
These `` shorthand '' or `` speed कॉलिंग '' numbers are automatically translated to unique telephone numbers before the call can be connected.
Some special services have their own short numbers ( e.g., 1-1-9, 9-1-1, 0-0-0, 9-9-9, 1-1-1, and 1-1-2 being the Emergency Services numbers for China, जापानी, South Korea, Taiwan and Sri Lanka ; Canada और the United States ; Australia ; the United Kingdom, आयरलैंड, South Africa, Poland, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, मोरक्को, Macao, Bahrain, Qatar, Bangladesh, बोत्सवाना, Ghana, Kenya, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mauritius, सिंगापुर, Zimbabwe, Trinidad, Tobago ; New Zealand ; Kuwait and the European Union, respectively. )
Many systems also allow calls within a लोकल area to be made without dialing the local area कोड.
For example, a फोन number in North America will start with तीन numbers ( such as 661 ), which is the area code, followed by seven digits split into sections of three and four ( such as 550-1212 ), जिससे is the local क्रमांक.
Some areas now have mandatory ten-digit डायलिंग in place, even for local calls.
Most telephone networks today ( exceptions being private intercom and सुरक्षित phone networks ) are interconnected in the international telephone network, where the format of telephone numbers is standardized by ITU-T in the recommendation E.164.
This specifies that the संपूर्ण क्रमांक should be 15 digits or shorter, and begin with a देश prefix.
For most countries, this is followed by an area code or city code और the subscriber number, which might consist of the code for a particular telephone exchange.
ITU-T recommendation E.123 describes how to represent an international telephone number in writing or print, starting with a plus sign ( `` + '' ) and the country code.
When calling an international number from a fixed line फोन, the + must be replaced with the international call prefix chosen by the country the call is being बना from.
Some mobile phones allow the + to be entered directly.
The format and allocation of local phone संख्याएँ are controlled by each nation 's respective government, either directly or by sponsored organizations ( such as nanpa overseen by NeuStar Inc. ).
Before a telephone call is connected, the टेलीफोन क्रमांक must be dialed by the calling party or Caller.
The called party might have equipment that presents caller ID before the call is answered.
A collection agency is a business that pursues भुगतान of debts owed by individuals or businesses.
Most collection agencies operate as agents of creditors and collect debts for a fee or percentage of the total amount owed.
There are many types of collection agencies.
First-party agencies are oftentimes subsidiaries of the असली company the debt is owed to.
Third-party agencies हैं separate companies contracted by a company to collect debts on their behalf for a fee.
कर्ज़ buyers purchase the debt at a percentage of its value, then attempt to collect it.
Each देश रै its own rules and regulations regarding them.

1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta ( 1st SFOD-D ), popularly ज्ञात as Delta Force, is one of the United States ' four secretive tier-one counter-terrorism और Special Mission Units.
It was formerly सूचीबद्ध as the Combat Applications Group by the Department of Defense but has since been officially re-designated the Army Compartmented Elements ( ACE ).
While 1st SFOD-D is administratively supported by USASOC, it falls under the operational control of the Joint Special Operations Command.
Delta Force and इसके Navy counterpart, the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, are the United राज्य military 's primary counter-terrorism units.
Delta Force 's primary tasks हैं counter-terrorism, direct action, and national intervention operations, although it is an extremely versatile group capable of conducting many प्रकार of covert missions, including, but not limited to, hostage rescues and raids.
The Central Intelligence Agency 's highly secretive Special Activities Division ( SAD ) and more specifically its elite Special Operations Group ( sog ) often works with – and रंगरूटों – ऑपरेटर from Delta Force.
Alpha decay is one example type of radioactive decay, in which an परमाणु nucleus emits an alpha particle, and thereby transforms ( or 'decays ' ) into an अणु with a द्रव्यमान number 4 कम and atomic number 2 less.
Many other types of decays are possible.
Radioactive क्षय, also known as नाभिकीय decay or radioactivity, is the process by which a nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting particles of ionizing radiation.
A सामग्री that spontaneously emits this kind of radiation — which includes the emission of energetic अल्फा particles, beta particles, and gamma rays — is considered radioactive.
There are many different प्रकार of radioactive decay ( देखिए table below ).
A decay, or loss of energy, results when an atom with one प्रकार of nucleus, called the parent radionuclide, transforms to an atom साथ a nucleus in a different state, or to a अलग nucleus containing different numbers of protons and neutrons.
Either of these products is named the daughter nuclide.
In some decays the parent and daughter are different chemical elements, और thus the decay process results in nuclear transmutation ( creation of an atom of a new element ).
The first decay processes to be discovered यहूद alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay.
Alpha decay occurs when the nucleus ejects an alpha particle ( helium nucleus ).
This is the most common process of emitting nucleons, but in rarer types of decays, nuclei can eject protons, or specific nuclei of other तत्व ( in the process called क्लस्टर decay ).
Beta decay occurs when the nucleus emits an electron or positron and a type of न्यूट्रिनो, in a process कि changes a proton to a neutron or the other way around.
The nucleus may कैप्चर an orbiting electron, converting a proton into a neutron ( electron capture ).
All of these processes result in nuclear transmutation.
By contrast, there exist radioactive decay processes that do not result in transmutation.
The energy of an excited केंद्रक may be emitted as a gamma रे in gamma decay, or used to eject an कक्षीय electron by interaction with the excited nucleus in a process called internal conversion.
Radioisotopes occasionally emit neutrons, and this results in a change in an element from one isotope to another.
One type of radioactive decay results in products which हैं नहीं defined, but appear in a range of `` टुकड़े '' of the original nucleus.
This decay is called spontaneous fission.
This decay happens when a large unstable nucleus spontaneously splits into two ( and occasionally three ) smaller बेटी nuclei, and usually emits gamma rays, neutrons, or other particles as a consequence.
Radioactive decay is a stochastic ( i.e., random ) process at the level of single atoms, in that, according to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay.
However, the chance that a given atom will क्षय is constant over time.
For a विशाल क्रमांक of atoms, the decay rate for the collection is computable from the measured decay constants of the nuclides ( or equivalently from the half-lifes ).
Waxing is a form of semi-permanent hair removal which removes the hair from the root.
New hair will not grow back in the previously waxed area लिये two to eight weeks, although some people will start to देखिए regrowth in only a सप्ताह.
Almost any area of the body can be waxed, including eyebrows, face, bikini क्षेत्रफल, legs, arms, back, उदर and feet.
There are many types of waxing suitable for removing अनावश्यक hair.
Strip waxing is accomplished by spreading a wax thinly over the skin.
A cloth or paper strip is then pressed on the top and ripped off the direction of hair growth.
This removes the मोम along with the hair.
Strip wax can भी be made at home using lemon juice, water, sugar और मधु.
Hot waxing utilizes Hot wax ( as opposed to strip wax ).
In this case, the wax is applied somewhat thickly and with no cloth or paper strips.
the wax then hardens when it cools, यूँ allowing the easy removal by a therapist without the aid of cloths.
This waxing method is very beneficial to people who have sensitive स्किन.

प्राचीन Roman culture existed throughout the almost 1200-year history of the civilization of Ancient Rome.
The term refers to the culture of the Roman Republic, later the रोमन Empire, which, at its peak, covered an क्षेत्रफल from lowland स्कॉटलैंड and Morocco to the Euphrates.
Life in प्राचीन Rome revolved around the city of रोम, its famed seven hills, और its monumental structures such as the Flavian Amphitheatre ( अभी पुकारा the Colosseum ), the Forum of Trajan, और the Pantheon.
The city also had several theaters, gymnasiums, and many taverns, baths, and brothels.
Throughout the territory under प्राचीन Rome 's control, residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas, and in the capital city of Rome, there were imperial residences on the सुरुचिपूर्ण Palatine Hill, from which the word palace is derived.
The vast majority of the population lived in the city center, packed into insulae ( अपार्टमेंट blocks ).
The city of Rome was the largest megalopolis of that time, with a population that may well have exceeded one million people, साथ a high end estimate of 3.6 million and a low end estimate of 450,000.
Historical estimates indicate that around 30 percent of the population under the नगर 's jurisdiction lived in innumerable urban centers, with जनसांख्यिकी of at least 10,000 and several military settlements, a बहुत high rate of urbanization by pre-industrial standards.
The most urbanized part of the Empire was Italy, which था an estimated rate of urbanization of 32 %, the same rate of urbanization of England in 1800.
Most रोमन towns and cities had a forum, temples and the same type of buildings, on a छोटी scale, as found in Rome.
The large urban population required an endless supply of food which was a जटिल logistical task, including acquiring, transporting, storing और distribution of food for Rome and other urban centers.
Italian farms supplied vegetables and फल, but fish और meat were luxuries.
Aqueducts were built to bring water to urban centers and wine and oil were imported from Hispania, Gaul and Africa.
There was a बहुत large amount of commerce between the provinces of the रोमन Empire, चूंकि its transportation technology was बहुत efficient.
The average costs of transport and the technology were comparable with 18th-century Europe.
The later नगर of Rome did not fill the space within its ancient Aurelian walls until after 1870.
Eighty प्रतिशत of the population under the jurisdiction of ancient Rome lived in the countryside in settlements with less than 10 thousand inhabitants.
Landlords generally resided in cities and their estates were left in the care of farm managers.
The plight of ग्रामीण slaves थी generally worse than their counterparts working in urban aristocratic households.
To stimulate a higher labor productivity most जमींदार freed a large number of स्लेव and अनेक received मजदूरी.
Some records indicate that `` as many as 42 people lived in एक small फार्म हट in Egypt, while six families owned a single olive tree. ''.
Such a rural environment continued to induce migration of population to urban centers until the early 2nd century, when the urban population stopped growing and started to decline.
Starting in the middle of the 2nd century BC, private Greek culture was increasingly in ascendancy, in spite of tirades against the `` softening '' effects of Hellenized संस्कृति इससे the रूढ़िवादी moralists.
By the time of Augustus, संस्कारी Greek household slaves taught the Roman young ( sometimes भी the लड़कियों ) ; chefs, decorators, secretaries, doctors, and hairdressers—all came from the Greek East.
यूनानी sculptures adorned Hellenistic landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the villas, or were imitated in Roman sculpture yards by यूनानी slaves.
The Roman cuisine preserved in the cookery books ascribed to Apicius is essentially Greek.
Roman writers disdained Latin for a cultured Greek style.
Only in law and governance was the Italic nature of Rome 's accretive संस्कृति supreme.
Against this human background, both the urban and rural setting, one of history 's most influential सभ्यताओं took shape, leaving behind a सांस्कृतिक legacy that survives in part today.

A season is a subdivision of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight.
Seasons result from the yearly revolution of the धरती around the Sun and the tilt of the धरती 's अक्ष relative to the plane of revolution.
In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that पहुँच the Earth 's surface, विसंगतियाँ of which may cause पशु to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During may, June and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the गोलार्ध faces the sun.
the same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December and जनवरी.
It is the झुकाव of the Earth that causes the सूर्य to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux.
However, due to seasonal lag, June, July and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In शीतोष्ण and subpolar regions, generally four calendar -आधारd seasons ( with their adjectives ) are recognized : spring ( vernal ), summer ( estival ), autumn ( autumnal ) and winter ( hibernal ).
However, ecologists mostly use a six season model for temperate जलवायु regions that includes pre-spring ( prevernal ) और late summer ( serotinal ) as distinct seasons along साथ the traditional four.
Hot regions have two or three seasons ; the rainy ( or wet, or monsoon ) season and the dry season, and in some tropical areas, a cool or mild season.
In some parts of the world, special `` सीज़न '' are loosely defined based on important events such as a hurricane season, tornado season or a wildfire season.

The Battle of Fort Sumter ( April 12–14, 1861 ) was the bombardment and surrender of Fort Sumter, near Charleston, South Carolina, that started the American Civil War.
Following declarations of secession by seven दक्षिणी राज्य, दक्षिण कैरोलिना demanded that the U.S. Army abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor.
On December 26, 1860, U.S. Major Robert Anderson surreptitiously moved his small command from the indefensible फोर्ट Moultrie on Sullivan 's Island to Fort Sumter, a substantial fortress controlling the प्रवेश of Charleston हार्बर.
An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson, using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West, failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861.
South Carolina authorities then seized all Federal property in the Charleston area, except for Fort sumter.
During the जल्दी months of 1861, the situation around Fort Sumter increasingly began to resemble a siege.
In March, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. beauregard, the पहला सामान्य अधिकारी of the newly formed Confederate States of America, was placed in command of Confederate शक्तियां in Charleston.
beauregard energetically directed the strengthening of batteries around Charleston harbor aimed at Fort Sumter.
Conditions in the fort grew dire as the Union soldiers rushed to complete the installation of additional बंदूकों.
Anderson was short of men, food, and supplies.
The resupply of Fort Sumter became the first crisis of the administration of President Abraham Lincoln.
He notified the Governor of South Carolina, Francis W. Pickens, कि he was sending supply ships, which resulted in an ultimatum from the Confederate सरकारी : evacuate Fort Sumter immediately.
प्रमुख Anderson refused to surrender.
Beginning at 4:30 a.m. on April 12, the Confederates bombarded the fort from artillery batteries surrounding the harbor.
Although the Union garrison returned fire, they were significantly outgunned and, after 34 hours, Major Anderson agreed to evacuate.
There was no loss of life on either पक्ष as a direct result of this engagement, हालांकि a gun explosion during the surrender ceremonies on April 14 caused two Union deaths.
Following the battle, there was widespread support from both North और South for further military action.
Lincoln 's तात्कालिक call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion resulted in an additional four southern slave states also declaring their secession और joining the Confederacy.
the Civil War था begun.
3G, short for third Generation, is the तीसरा generation of मोबाईल telecommunications technology.
3G telecommunication networks support services that provide an information transfer rate of at least 200 kbit/s.
However, many services advertised as 3G provide higher speed than the minimum technical requirements for a 3G service.
Recent 3G releases, often denoted 3.5G and 3.75G, also provide mobile broadband access of several Mbit/s to स्मार्टफ़ोन and mobile modems in laptop computers.
3G finds application in wireless आवाज़ telephony, mobile Internet access, fixed wireless Internet access, video calls and mobile TV.

Traditionally, after the groom breaks the glass, the guests shout `` Mazel Tov ! ``.
A जन्मदिवस cake, iced with the words `` מזל טוב '' ( mazal tov ), as is often done in Israel.
Here the phrase is written in Hebrew cursive.
`` Mazel tov '' or `` mazal tov '' ( यहूदी / Yiddish : `` מזל טוב '', Hebrew : `` mazal tov '' ; Yiddish : `` mazel tov '' ; lit.

hepatitis C is an infectious disease affecting primarily the liver, caused by the hepatitis C virus ( HCV ).
The infection is often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can lead to scarring of the liver and ultimately to cirrhosis, which is generally apparent after many years.
In some cases, those with cirrhosis will go on to develop liver failure, liver cancer or life-threatening esophageal and gastric varices.
hcv is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment and transfusions.
An estimated 130–200 million people worldwide are infected with.
The अस्तित्व of ( originally `` non- A non- B hepatitis '' ) was postulated in the 1970s and proven in 1989.
only infects humans and chimpanzees.
The virus persists in the liver in about 85 % of those infected.
This persistent infection can be treated with medication : the standard therapy is a संयोजन of peginterferon and ribavirin, with either boceprevir or telaprevir added in some cases.
Overall, 50–80 % of लोगों treated हैं cured.
Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver प्रत्यारोपण.

A flexible spending account ( FSA ), also known as a flexible spending arrangement, is one of a क्रमांक of tax-advantaged financial accounts that can be set up through a cafeteria plan of an employer in the United States.
An FSA allows an employee to set aside a portion of आय to pay for qualified खर्च as established in the cafeteria योजना, most commonly for medical expenses but often for dependent care or other expenses.
Money deducted from an कर्मचारी 's pay into an FSA is नहीं subject to payroll taxes, resulting in substantial payroll कर बचत.
One significant disadvantage to using an FSA is that funds not प्रयुक्त by the समाप्त of the plan year are खोया to the employee, known as the `` use it or lose it '' rule.
The most common type of लचीली बिता account, the medical expense fsa ( also medical FSA or health FSA ), is similar to a health savings account ( hsa ) or a health reimbursement account ( HRA ).
However, while HSAs and HRAs are almost exclusively used as components of a consumer driven health care plan, medical FSAs are commonly offered साथ अधिक traditional health plans as well.
in जोड, funds in a health savings account are not lost when the plan year is over, unlike funds in an FSA.
Paper forms or an FSA debit कार्ड, भी known as a flexcard, may be used to access the खाता funds.
Tennessee ( ) ( ) is a U.S. state स्तिथ in the Southeastern United राज्य.
Tennessee is the 36th most extensive and the 17th most populous of the 50 United States.
Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky और वर्जिनिया to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west.
The Appalachian Mountains dominate the पूर्वी part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state 's western border.
Tennessee 's capital और second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 609,644.
Memphis is the state 's largest city, with a population of 652,050.
The state of Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association, a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the पहला constitutional government west of the Appalachians.
What is now Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later भाग of the Southwest Territory.
Tennessee was admitted to the संघ as the 16th state on June 1, 1796.
Tennessee was the last state to leave the Union and join the Confederacy at the outbreak of the U.S. Civil युद्ध in 1861, and the first state to be readmitted to the संघ at the end of the war.
Tennessee furnished more soldiers for the Confederate Army than any other state, and more soldiers for the Union Army than any other Southern state.
In the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy, aided at times by संघीय entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority.
In the early 1940s, the नगर of ओक Ridge was established to house the मैनहटन Project 's uranium enrichment facilities, helping to build the world 's first atomic bomb.
Tennessee has played a critical role in the विकास of many forms of American popular music, including चट्टान and roll, blues, country, and rockabilly.
Beale Street in Memphis is considered by many to be the जन्मस्थान of the blues, with संगीतकारों such as W.C. सुलभ performing in its clubs as early as 1909.
Memphis was also home to सूर्य Records, where musicians such as एल्विस Presley, Isaac हेज़, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, और Charlie Rich began उनके recording careers, and where rock and roll took shape in the 1950s.
The 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the Grand ओले Opry in the 1930s helped make Nashville the center of the country music recording industry.
Three ईंटें and mortar museums recognize Tennessee 's role in nurturing various forms of popular music : the Memphis Rock N ' Soul Museum, the Country Music Hall of Fame और Museum in Nashville, and the International Rock-A-Billy Museum in Jackson.
In addition, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, an online site recognizing the development of rockabilly in जिससे टेनेसी played a crucial role, is based in Nashville.
Tennessee 's major उद्योग include कृषि, manufacturing, and tourism.
Poultry, soybeans, and cattle are the state 's primary agricultural products, and major manufacturing निर्यात include chemicals, परिवहन उपकरण, and electrical equipment.
The Great smoky kyu National Park, the nation 's most visited national पार्क, is headquartered in the eastern part of the राज्य, and a section of the Appalachian Trail roughly follows the Tennessee-North Carolina border.
Other major tourist attractions शामिल the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, the Sunsphere in Knoxville, Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, the Parthenon, the Country Music Hall of Fame and संग्रहालय, and Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, and Elvis Presley 's Graceland निवास and tomb in Memphis.
One design variant of a cock ring.
a cock ring is a रिंग that can be placed around a man 's penis, usually at the base, primarily to slow the flow of blood from the erect penile tissue, thus maintaining an erection for a much longer period of time.
Cock rings can be worn around just the penis or both the penis and scrotum, or just the scrotum alone, हालांकि this is usually called a testicle cuff.
Rings can be made of a variety of अलग materials, most commonly leather, rubber, or silicone, though nylon and metal are also used either as the main component or part of the closure.
The term cock ring is sometimes used as a synonym for a Prince Albert piercing, a piercing of the penis that is usually, though नहीं always, a metal ring.
When used in cases of erectile dysfunction they are known by various names such as `` erection ring '' and `` टेंशन ring ''.
The headquarters of Major League Baseball at 245 Park Avenue, Midtown Manhattan, New York नगर, USA.
Major League Baseball ( MLB ) is a professional baseball लीग, consisting of teams कि play in the National लीग and the American लीग.
Dating to 1876 and 1901 respectively, the दो leagues merged in 2000 into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball, after 100 years as separate legal entities.
MLB constitutes one of the major professional खेल leagues of the संयुक्त States and Canada.
It is composed of 30 teams — 29 in the संयुक्त States and one in Canada.
Teams in MLB play 162 खेल each season over six months ( April through September ).
Five टीमों in each league advance to a four-round postseason tournament that culminates in the World Series, a best-of-seven-games championship series between the two league champions जिससे dates to 1903.
The organization oversees many minor-league baseball leagues which operate about 240 teams affiliated with the major-league clubs.
With the International Baseball Federation, the league also manages the international World Baseball Classic tournament.
MLB has the highest season attendance of any sports league in the world with nearly 75 million spectators in 2012.
Delaware ( ) is a U.S. state located on the Atlantic Coast in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.
It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New जर्सी, and to the उत्तर by Pennsylvania.
the state takes its name इससे Thomas वेस्ट, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia 's first colonial governor, after whom what is now called Cape Henlopen was originally named.
Delaware is located in the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula and is the second smallest, the sixth least populous, but the छठे most densely आबादी of the fifty संयुक्त States.
Delaware is divided into three counties.
From north to south, these तीन counties are New Castle, Kent, and Sussex.
While the southern दो counties have historically been predominantly agricultural, New Castle County has been more industrialized.
Before इसके coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by अनेक groups of Native Americans, including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south.
It was initially colonized by डच traders at Zwaanendael, स्तिथ near the present कस्बा of Lewes, in 1631.
Delaware was one of the 13 colonies participating in the American Revolution and on December 7, 1787, became the first state to ratify the Constitution of the United राज्य, thereby becoming known as The First State.
Energy Transformation in Energy Systems Language
Energy transformation or energy conversion is the process of changing one form of energy to another.
In physics, the term energy describes the capacity to produce certain changes within a system, without regard to limitations in transformation imposed by Entropy.
Changes in total उर्जा of systems can only be accomplished by adding or subtracting energy इससे them, as energy is a मात्रा which is conserved, according to the first law of thermodynamics.
According to special आपेक्षिकता, परिवर्तन in the energy of systems will also coincide with changes in the system 's द्रव्यमान, and the total amount of mass of a प्रणाली is a माप of its energy.
Energy in a system may be transformed so that it resides in a different state, or a different प्रकार of energy.
उर्जा in many states may be used to do many varieties of physical work.
Energy may be used in natural processes or मशीने, or else to provide some service to society ( such as heat, light, or गति ).
For example, an internal combustion engine converts the potential chemical energy in gasoline and oxygen into heat, which is then रूपांतरित into the propulsive energy ( kinetic energy that moves a vehicle ).
A solar cell converts solar radiation into विद्युत energy that can then be प्रयुक्त to light a bulb or power a computer.
the generic name for a device which converts energy from one form to another, is a transducer.
In general, most types of energy, save for thermal energy, may be converted efficiently to any other kind of energy.
Sometimes this occurs with an efficiency of essentially 100 %, such as when potential energy is converted to गतिज energy as an object falls in vacuum, or when it orbits nearer or farther from another object, in स्पेस.
Conversion of other types of energies to heat may also occurs with nearly perfect efficiency ( many types of friction do this ).
Exceptions for perfect conversion efficiency ( even for isolated systems ) occur when energy has already महरूम partly वितरित among अनेक available quantum states for a collection of particles, which are freely allowed to explore any राज्य of momentum and position ( phase space ).
In such circumstances, a measure called Entropy, or evening-out of energy distribution in such states, dictates that future states of the प्रणाली must be of at least equal evenness in energy distribution.
( There is no way, taking the universe as a whole, to collect energy into fewer states, once it has spread to them ).
A consequence of this requirement is that there are limitations to the efficiency साथ which thermal energy can be converted to other kinds of energy, चूंकि thermal energy in equilibrium at a given temperature already represents the maximal evening-out of energy between all possible states.
Such उर्जा is sometimes considered `` degraded उर्जा, '' because it is not entirely usable.
The second law of thermodynamics is a way of stating that, for this कारण, thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100 %, only if the entropy ( even-ness or disorder ) of the universe is increased by other means, to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal उर्जा and its entropy content.
Otherwise, only a part of thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy ( and thus, useful कार्य ), since the remainder of the ऊष्मा must be reserved to be transferred to a थर्मल reservoir at a lower temperature, in such a way that the increase in Entropy for this process more than compensates for the एन्ट्रॉपी decrease संबद्ध with transformation of the rest of the heat into अन्य types of energy.
The National Hockey League ( NHL ; ) is an `` unincorporated not-for-profit association '' जिससे operates a major professional ice hockey league of 30 franchised member clubs, of which seven are currently located in Canada and 23 in the United States.
Headquartered in नई York नगर, the NHL is widely considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.
the स्टेनली कप, the oldest professional खेल trophy in North अमेरिका, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.
The league was organized on November 26, 1917, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization, the National Hockey Association ( नह ), which had been संस्थापित in 1909.
It started with four teams and, through a series of expansions, contractions, and relocations, the league is now composed of 30 active franchises.
The nation to which the name of the लीग originally referred was Canada, although the league has अभी been binational since 1924 when it expanded into the United States.
बाद a labour dispute that led to the cancellation of the entire 2004–05 ऋतु, the league resumed play अंतर्गत a new collective bargaining agreement that included a salary cap.
In 2009, the NHL enjoyed record highs in terms of sponsorships, attendance, and television audiences.
The NHL draws many अत्यधिक skilled players from all over the world and currently has players from about 20 different countries.
Although Canadians have historically constituted the majority of the players in the NHL, over the past four plus decades the percentages of US and European players have increased both because of the NHL 's continued expansion from six to thirty clubs since 1967, and the increased availability of highly skilled European players.
This is the complete list of the ratified and unratified amendments to the United States Constitution which प्राप्त the approval of the United States Congress.
twenty-seven amendments have been ratified since the original signing of the Constitution, the first टेन of which are known collectively as the विधेयक of Rights.
The कार्यविधि for amending the United States Constitution is governed by Article V of the original टेक्स्ट.
There have been अनेक other proposals for amendments to the United States Constitution introduced in Congress, but not submitted to the states.
पहले an amendment can take effect, it must be proposed to the states by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or by a convention ( known as an Article V सम्मेलन ) called by two-thirds of the states, and ratified by three-fourths of the states or by three-fourths of conventions thereof, the method of ratification being determined by Congress at the time of proposal.
To date, no सम्मेलन for proposing amendments has been called by the states, and only once—in 1933 for the ratification of the twenty-first amendment —has the convention विधि of ratification been employed.

The war had its origin in the समस्या of slavery, especially the extension of slavery into the western territories.
विदेशी powers did not intervene.
After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South 's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and the मुश्किल Reconstruction process of restoring नेशनल unity और guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began.
In the 1860 presidential election, Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, opposed expanding slavery into United States ' territories.

Gaius Julius Caesar (, July 100 BC – 15 कूच 44 BC ) was a Roman general, statesman, कौंसुल and notable author of Latin गद्य.
He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman साम्राज्य.
In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that was to dominate Roman politics for several years.
Their attempts to amass power through populist tactics were opposed by the conservative elite भीतर the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of सिसरो.
Caesar 's conquest of Gaul, completed by 51 BC, extended रोम 's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine.
Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain.
These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the मौत of Crassus in 53 BC.
With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to lay down his military command and वापसी to Rome.
Caesar refused, and marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the rubicon with a legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman territory under arms.
Civil war resulted, from which he emerged as the unrivaled leader of रोम.

But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved, and on the Ides of March ( 15 March ) 44 BC, सीज़र was assassinated by a group of senators led by Marcus junius ब्रूटस.
A new series of civil wars broke out, and the constitutional government of the Republic थी never restored.
Caesar 's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power, और the era of the Roman Empire began.

In the United States, the title of federal judge usually means a न्यायधीश appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United राज्य Senate pursuant to the Appointments Clause in Article II of the United States Constitution.
In addition to the Supreme Court of the United States, whose existence and some aspects of whose jurisdiction are beyond the constitutional power of Congress to alter, acts of Congress have established 13 courts of appeals ( also called `` circuit courts '' ) with appellate jurisdiction over different regions of the United राज्य, and 94 संयुक्त States district courts.
Every न्यायधीश appointed to such a court may be categorized as a संघीय judge ; such positions include the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, Circuit Judges of the courts of appeals, and district judges of the United States district courts.
All of ये judges described thus far are referred to sometimes as `` Article III judges '' क्युकी they exercise the न्यायिक power vested in the न्यायिक branch of the federal government by Article III of the U.S. Constitution.
In addition, judges of the Court of International Trade exercise न्यायिक power pursuant to Article III.
अन्य judges serving in the federal courts, including मजिस्ट्रेट judges and bankruptcy judges, हैं also sometimes referred to as `` संघीय judges '' ; however, they are neither नियुक्त by the President nor confirmed by the Senate, and their power derives from Article I instead.

Touch is a crucial means of receiving information.
This photo shows tactile markings identifying stairs लिये visually impaired people.
The somatosensory system is a विविध sensory system comprising the receptors and processing centres to produce the sensory modalities such as touch, temperature, proprioception ( body position ), and nociception ( pain ).
the sensory receptors cover the skin and epithelia, skeletal muscles, bones and joints, internal organs, and the cardiovascular system.
While touch is considered one of the five traditional senses, the impression of touch is formed from अनेक modalities.
In medicine, the colloquial term `` touch '' is usually replaced with `` somatic होश '' to better reflect the किस्में of mechanisms involved.
Somatic senses are sometimes referred to as somesthetic senses, with the understanding that somesthesis includes touch, proprioception and ( depending on usage ) also haptic perception.
The system reacts to diverse stimuli using different receptors : thermoreceptors, nociceptors, mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors.
Transmission of information from the receptors passes via sensory nerves through tracts in the spinal cord and into the दिमाग.
Processing primarily occurs in the primary somatosensory area in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex.
The cortical homunculus थी devised by Wilder penfield.
At its simplest, the system works when activity in a संवेदी neuron is triggered by a specific stimulus such as heat ; this signal eventually passes to an area in the brain uniquely attributed to that area on the body—this allows the processed stimulus to be felt at the correct location.
The point-to-point मानचित्रण of the देह surfaces in the brain is called a homunculus and is essential in the creation of a body image.
This brain-surface ( `` cortical '' ) map is not immutable, however.
Dramatic shifts can occur in response to stroke or injury.
Magnolia is a large genus of about 210 flowering plant species in the subfamily magnolioideae of the family Magnoliaceae.
It is named after French botanist Pierre Magnol.
Magnolia is an ancient genus.
Appearing before मधुमक्खियों did, the flowers evolved to encourage pollination by beetles.
To avoid damage from pollinating beetles, the carpels of Magnolia flowers हैं extremely tough.
Fossilised specimens of Magnolia acuminata have been found dating to 20 million years ago, and of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae डेटिंग to 95 million years ago.
Another aspect of Magnolias that is considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a bract rather than in sepals ; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals.
Magnolia shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering plants near the base of the flowering plant lineage such as Amborella and Nymphaea ( as well as साथ many more recently derived plants such as लिलि ).
The natural range of Magnolia species is a disjunct distribution, with a main centre in east and southeast Asia and a secondary केन्द्र in eastern North America, सेंट्रल America, the West Indies, and some species in South America.

`` White Christmas '' is an Irving Berlin song reminiscing about an old-fashioned Christmas setting.
According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the संस्करण sung by Bing Crosby is the best-selling सिंगल of all time, with estimated sales in excess of 50 million copies worldwide.
Accounts vary as to when and where Berlin लिखा the song.
One story is that he wrote it in 1940, in warm la quinta, California, while staying at the La Quinta होटल, a frequent Hollywood retreat also favored by writer-producer Frank Capra, although the Arizona Biltmore also claims the song was written there.
He often stayed up all night writing — he told his secretary, `` Grab your pen and take down this song.
I just wrote the best song I 've ever written — heck, I just wrote the best song that anybody 's ever written ! ''
Cross-country skiing ( or XC skiing ) is a form of ski touring in which participants propel themselves across snow-covered terrain using skis and डंडे.

A use tax in United States is complementary to sales tax which means, if you buy a Taxable product/services without paying any Sales tax to vendor, you owe use tax.
You must स्वः assess उपयोग tax and pay it directly to the state where the products were consumed or services were rendered.
Use tax typically is a tax on consumption but if you buy an item ( without paying sales tax ) and store it in your गोदाम initially, उपयोग tax applies to that location where goods were stored.
Later on when the final consumption takes place at some other location, you are जरूरी to pay the differential of tax रेट to the jurisdiction of ultimate place of consumption.
This really means that you do n't have to pay both Sales Tax as well as Use Tax on one transaction.
It is तभी one or the other that तुम are जरूरी to pay on purchase of taxable products/services.
If vendor does n't charge any Sales tax on its invoice then it is the obligation of the buyer to self assess Use tax and pay it to the appropriate Jurisdication.
Use Tax is generally charged at the वही tax रेट of बिक्री Tax but in some states the tax rate is different.
Use tax is also termed as `` Consumption कर '' or `` Consumer Use Tax ''.
A use tax is a type of excise tax levied in the United States by numerous state governments.
It is assessed upon tangible personal property purchased by a resident of the assessing state for use, storage, or consumption in that state ( not for resale ), regardless of जहाँ the purchase took place.
if a resident of a state makes a purchase within his home state, full sales tax is paid at the time of the transaction.
The use tax applies when a resident of the assessing state purchases an item that is not विषय to his home state 's बिक्री tax.
Usually, this is due to out-of-state purchases, as well as ordering items through the मेल, by phone, or over the Internet from other states.
the use tax is typically assessed at the वही rate as the sales कर that would have been owed ( if any ) had the same goods been purchased in the state of residence.
लिये example, a resident of Massachusetts, with a 6.25 % `` बिक्री and use tax '' on certain goods and सेवाएं, purchases non-exempt goods or services in New Hampshire for use, storage or other consumption in Massachusetts.
Under New Hampshire law, the New Hampshire vendor collects no sales taxes on the goods, but the मैसाचुसेट्स purchaser/user must still pay 6.25 % of the sales price सीधे to the Department of Revenue in मैसाचुसेट्स as a उपयोग tax.
If the same goods are purchased in a US state that does collect sales tax for such goods at time of purchase, whatever taxes were paid by the purchaser to that state can be deducted ( as a tax credit ) from the 6.25 % owed for subsequent use, storage or consumption in मैसाचुसेट्स.
With few exceptions, no state 's vendors will charge the native state 's sales tax on goods shipped out of state, meaning सब goods ordered from out-of-state are essentially free of sales tax.
The क्रेता is therefore required to declare and pay the use tax to his home state on these ordered goods.
The assessing jurisdiction may make the use कर देय annually, लकिन some states require a monthly payment.
For example, where a Vermont resident has not paid at least 6 % sales tax on property brought in for use in the state, Vermont law requires दाखिल a tax return ( रूप SU-452 और payment ) by the 20th day of the month following non-exempt purchases to avoid a $ 50 late fee, a 5 % penalty प्रति month, to a maximum of 25 %, plus statutory interest on the unpaid कर and penalties.
ठेठ exemptions शामिल purchases by charitable non-profit organizations or governmental एजेंसियों, purchases for resale in commerce, and purchases via `` casual sales '' by individuals not in the ordinary course of business.
Also note that there हैं thousands of कर jurisdictions in the U.S. and many have ever-changing lists of specific types of goods and services that are not taxable.
As an illustration of the complexities : a 2006 Massachusetts law requires भुगतान of tax on `` pre-written '' ( not custom ) software purchased and downloaded over the Internet for संस्थापना and उपयोग in Massachusetts, regardless of where it originates.
However, the actual use of the same software डाउनलोड by a Massachusetts resident to a server in another state remains a non-taxed `` service ''.
In contrast, Arkansas generally does not tax anything delivered over the Internet ( such as downloaded software or music ), except VoIP which is specifically defined as taxable `` telecommunications services ''.
Software ( pre-written or custom ) `` delivered thru a tangible medium '' ( i.e., on disk ) in Arkansas is taxable even if ordered online, मगर `` custom software for a particular customer '' which is non-taxable `` programming services '' even if delivered on a disk.
In most cases, this complexity is part of the underlying sales tax laws ; but जबकि a brick-and-mortar store has to deal with तभी the sales tax कानून of its own location, रिमोट sellers have to deal with the use tax laws of अनेक jurisdictions—up to every US state and locality that assesses them, if the company has a presence or `` नेक्सस '' in प्रत्येक state ( as large `` brick-and-mortar '' sellers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy do ).
In medicine, pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) is an increase of blood pressure in the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, or pulmonary capillaries, साथ known as the फेफड़ों vasculature, leading to shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, and other symptoms, all of जिससे are exacerbated by exertion.

In computer science, array programming languages ( also known as vector or multidimensional languages ) generalize operations on scalars to लागू transparently to vectors, matrices, and higher dimensional arrays.
Array programming primitives concisely express व्यापक ideas about data manipulation.
The level of conciseness can be dramatic in certain cases : it is not uncommon to find array programming language one-liners that require more than a couple of pages of Java कोड.
APL, designed by Ken Iverson, was the first programming language to provide array प्रोग्रामिंग capabilities.
The mnemonic APL refers to the title of उसके seminal book `` A Programming Language '' and not to arrays per se. Iverson 's contribution to rigor and clarity was probably more important than the सरल extension of dimensions to functions.
in the United States an annuity contract is created when an insured party, usually an individual, pays a life बीमे company a single premium that होगा later be distributed back to the insured party over time.

नाभिकीय power is the उपयोग of sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and electricity.
Nuclear शक्ति पौधे provided about 5.7 % of the world 's energy and 13 % of the world 's electricity, in 2012.
In 2013, the IAEA report that there are 437 operational nuclear शक्ति reactors ( although not all are producing electricity ), in 31 countries.
In addition, there are approximately 140 naval vessels using nuclear नोदन in operation, powered by कुछ 180 reactors.
There is an ongoing debate about the use of nuclear energy.
Proponents, such as the World Nuclear Association, the IAEA and Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy contend that nuclear power is a sustainable उर्जा source कि reduces carbon emissions.
Opponents, such as Greenpeace International and nirs, believe that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment.
Nuclear power plant accidents शामिल the Chernobyl disaster ( 1986 ), Fukushima Daiichi nuclear विपत्ति ( 2011 ), and the Three Mile Island accident ( 1979 ).
There have also been some nuclear-powered submarine mishaps.
Research into safety improvements is continuing and nuclear fusion, believed to be safer, may be used in the future.

In the US the licenses of almost half its reactors have महरूम extended to 60 years, and plans to build another dozen are under serious consideration.
However, जापानी 's 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster prompted a rethink of nuclear उर्जा policy in many countries.
Germany decided to close all its reactors by 2022, and Italy has banned nuclear शक्ति.
Following Fukushima, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be निर्मित by 2035.
Photograph of the Berlin वॉल taken from the West side.
The Wall थी built in 1961 to prevent East Germans from fleeing from Communism.
It was an iconic symbol of the Cold War and its fall in 1989 marked the समाप्त of the War.
The Cold War, often dated from 1947 to 1991, was a sustained state of political and military tension between powers in the Western Bloc, वर्चस्व by the United States साथ NATO among its allies, and powers in the Eastern Bloc, dominated by the Soviet Union along with the Warsaw Pact.
This began after the success of उनके temporary wartime alliance विरूद्ध नाजी Germany, leaving the USSR and the US as two superpowers with profound economic and political differences.
A neutral faction arose with the Non-Aligned Movement founded by Egypt, India, and Yugoslavia ; this faction rejected association with either the us-led West or the Soviet-led East.
The Cold War was so नामित because the two major powers—each possessing nuclear weapons and thereby threatened with परस्पर assured destruction —never met in direct military combat.
Instead, in their struggle for वैश्विक influence they engaged in जारी psychological warfare and in regular indirect confrontations through proxy युद्धों.
Cycles of relative calm would be followed by high tension, which could have led to world war.

Hurricane कैटरीना was the deadliest and most destructive Atlantic hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.
It was the costliest natural disaster, as well as one of the five deadliest hurricanes, in the history of the United States.
Among recorded Atlantic hurricanes, it was the sixth strongest overall.
at least 1,833 people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods, making it the deadliest U.S. hurricane since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane ; total property damage was estimated at $ 81 billion ( 2005 USD ), nearly triple the damage brought by Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
Hurricane Katrina formed over the Bahamas on August 23, 2005 and crossed southern Florida as a moderate Category 1 hurricane, causing some deaths and flooding there before strengthening rapidly in the Gulf of Mexico.
The hurricane strengthened to a Category 5 hurricane over the warm Gulf water, but weakened before making its second landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on the morning of Monday, August 29 in southeast Louisiana.
It caused severe destruction along the Gulf coast from central Florida to Texas, much of it due to the storm surge.
the most significant क्रमांक of deaths occurred in New Orleans, Louisiana, which flooded as the levee system catastrophically failed, in many cases hours after the storm had moved inland.
Eventually 80 % of the city and large tracts of neighboring parishes became flooded, and the floodwaters lingered for weeks.
However, the worst property क्षति occurred in coastal areas, such as all Mississippi beachfront towns, जिससे were flooded over 90 % in hours, as boats and casino barges rammed buildings, pushing cars and houses inland, साथ waters reaching 6–12 miles ( 10–19 km ) इससे the beach.
the hurricane surge protection failures in New ऑरलियन्स are considered the worst civil engineering disaster in U.S. history and prompted a मुकदमा against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( USACE ), the designers और builders of the levee system as mandated by the बाढ़ Control Act of 1965.
Responsibility for the failures and flooding was laid squarely on the Army Corps in January 2008 by Judge Stanwood Duval, U.S. District अदालत, but the federal agency could not be held financially liable due to sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928.
There was also an investigation of the responses from federal, state and local governments, resulting in the इस्तीफा of Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) director Michael D. Brown, and of New Orleans पुलिस विभाग ( NOPD ) Superintendent Eddie Compass.
Several एजेंसियों including the United States Coast Guard ( USCG ), National Hurricane बीच ( NHC ), and National Weather सेवा ( NWS ) were commended for their actions.

However, the original definition of an assist did not include ऐसे situations, so the comparison of assist आंकडे across eras is a complex matter.
Only the pass directly पहले the score may be counted as an assist, so no more than one assist can be अंकित per field goal ( unlike in other sports, such as बर्फ hockey ).
a pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by free throws does not count as an assist in the एनबीए, but करता in FIBA play ( only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in which at least one free throw is made ).
Point guards tend to get the most assists per game ( apg ), as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandler.
Centers tend to get fewer assists, लकिन centers साथ good floor presence and अदालत vision can dominate a team by assisting.
Being inside the key, the center often has the best angles and the best position for `` dishes '' and other short passes in the scoring area.
Center Wilt Chamberlain led the NBA in assists in 1968.
A strong center with inside-scoring prowess, such as former NBA center Hakeem Olajuwon, can भी be an effective assistor because the defense 's double-teaming tends to open up offense in the form of shooters.
The एनबीए single-game assist record is 30, held by स्कॉट skiles of the Orlando Magic against the Denver Nuggets, on December 30, 1990.
The NBA record for most करियर assists is held by John स्टॉकटन with 15,806.
The mill or mille ( ) ( sometimes mil in the UK, when discussing property taxes in the United States, or previously in Cyprus and Malta ) is a now-abstract unit of currency used sometimes in accounting.
In the United States, it is a notional unit equivalent to of a United States dollar ( a tenth of a cent ).
In the United Kingdom it was proposed during the decades of discussion on the decimalization of the pound as a division of the pound sterling.
Several other currencies used the mill, such as the Maltese lira.
The term comes from the Latin `` millesimum '', meaning `` thousandth भाग ''.
The Greco-Persian Wars ( also often called the Persian Wars ) were a series of विरोध between the Achaemenid Empire of फारस and city-states of the Hellenic world that started in 499 BC और lasted until 449 BC.
The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks और the enormous empire of the फारसियों began when Cyrus the Great conquered Ionia in 547 BC.
Struggling to rule the independent-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them.
This would prove to be the source of much trouble लिये the Greeks and Persians alike.
In 499 BC, the then tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, embarked on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos, with Persian support ; however, the expedition was a debacle and, pre-empting his dismissal, Aristagoras incited सब of Hellenic एशिया Minor into rebellion against the Persians.
इस was the beginning of the Ionian Revolt, which would last until 493 BC, progressively drawing more regions of एशिया Minor into the conflict.
Aristagoras secured military support from Athens and Eretria, and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis.
The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on Athens and Eretria for this act.
The revolt continued, with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497–495 BC.
In 494 BC, the Persians regrouped, और attacked the epicentre of the revolt in Miletus.
At the Battle of Lade, the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat, and the rebellion collapsed, with the final members being stamped out the following year.
seeking to secure his empire from further revolts and from the interference of the mainland Greeks, Darius embarked on a scheme to conquer Greece and to punish Athens and Eretria for burning Sardis.
The पहला Persian invasion of Greece began in 492 BC, with the पारसी general Mardonius conquering Thrace and Macedon before several mishaps forced an early end to the campaign.
in 490 BC a second फ़ोर्स was sent to Greece, इस time across the Aegean समुद्र, अंतर्गत the कमांड of Datis and Artaphernes.
This expedition subjugated the Cyclades, before besieging, capturing और razing Eretria.
However, while en route to attack Athens, the Persian फ़ोर्स was decisively defeated by the Athenians at the बैटल of Marathon, समाप्ति Persian efforts for the time होने.
Darius then began to plan to complete the conquest of Greece, but died in 486 BC and responsibility for the conquest passed to his son Xerxes I.
in 480 BC, xerxes personally led the second Persian invasion of Greece with one of the largest ancient सेना कभी assembled.
Victory over the 'Allied ' Greek states ( led by Sparta and Athens ) at the Battle of Thermopylae allowed the Persians to torch Athens and overrun सबसे of Greece.
However, while seeking to destroy the combined Greek fleet, the Persians suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of Salamis.
The following year, the confederated Greeks went on the offensive, defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea, and समाप्ति the invasion of Greece.
The allied Greeks followed up their success by destroying the rest of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale, before expelling पारसी garrisons from Sestos ( 479 BC ) and Byzantium ( 478 BC ).
The actions of the general Pausanias at the घेरा of Byzantium alienated अनेक of the Greek राज्य from the Spartans, and the anti-Persian alliance was therefore reconstituted around Athenian leadership, as the so-called Delian League.
The delian League continued to campaign विरूद्ध Persia for the next three decades, शुरूआत with the expulsion of the remaining Persian garrisons from Europe.
At the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 BC, the League won a double victory that finally secured freedom for the cities of Ionia.
However, the League 's involvement in an मिश्र revolt ( from 460–454 BC ) resulted in a disastrous defeat, and further campaigning was suspended.
A fleet थी sent to Cyprus in 451 BC, but achieved little, और when it withdrew the Greco-Persian Wars खींचा to a quiet end.
Some historical स्त्रोत suggest the end of hostilities थी marked by a सलाम treaty between Athens and Persia, the so-called Peace of Callias.

A schematic presentation of the plum pudding model of the atom ; in Thomson 's mathematical model the `` corpuscles '' ( or modern electrons ) were arranged non-randomly, in rotating rings
The current model of the sub-atomic ढांचा involves a dense nucleus surrounded by a probabilistic `` cloud '' of electrons
The plum pudding model of the atom by J. J. Thomson, who discovered the electron in 1897, थी proposed in 1904 before the डिस्कवरी of the परमाणु nucleus in order to add the electron to the atomic model.
In this model, the atom is रचित of electrons ( which Thomson still called `` corpuscles '', though G. J. Stoney had proposed that atoms of electricity be called electrons in 1894 ) surrounded by a soup of positive charge to balance the electrons ' negative charges, like negatively charged `` plums `` surrounded by positively charged `` pudding ``.
the electrons ( as we know them today ) were thought to be positioned throughout the atom, but with many structures possible for positioning multiple electrons, particularly rotating rings of electrons ( see below ).
Instead of a soup, the atom was also sometimes said to have had a `` cloud '' of धनात्मक charge.
With this model, Thomson abandoned his पहले `` nebular atom '' परिकल्पना in which the atom थी composed of immaterial vortices.
Now, at तनिक part of the atom was to be composed of Thomson 's particulate negative corpuscles, although the rest of the positively charged part of the atom remained somewhat nebulous and ill-defined.
The 1904 Thomson model was disproved by the 1909 gold foil experiment of Hans geiger and Ernest Marsden.
This was interpreted by Ernest Rutherford in 1911
to imply a very small nucleus of the atom containing a very high positive charge ( in the case of gold, enough to balance about 100 electrons ), thus leading to the रदरफोर्ड model of the atom.
Although gold has an atomic number of 79, immediately after Rutherford 's paper appeared in 1911 Antonius Van den broek made the intuitive suggestion that atomic number is nuclear चार्ज.
The matter required experiment to decide.
Henry Moseley 's work showed experimentally in 1913 ( see Moseley 's law ) that the effective nuclear charge was very close to the atomic number ( Moseley found only one unit अंतर ), and Moseley referenced only the papers of वैन den Broek and Rutherford.
This work culminated in the solar-system-like ( but quantum-limited ) bohr model of the atom in the same year, in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charge is घिरी by an equal number of electrons in orbital shells.
Bohr had also inspired Moseley 's work.
Thomson 's model was compared ( though not by Thomson ) to a British dessert called प्लम pudding, hence the name.
Thomson 's paper was published in the March 1904 edition of the Philosophical Magazine, the अग्रणी British science journal of the day.
In Thomson 's view :... the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification,...
In this मॉडल, the electrons were फ़्री to rotate within the blob or बादल of positive substance.
These orbits were stabilized in the model by the fact that जब an electron moved farther from the center of the positive cloud, it felt a larger net positive inward force, because there was more material of opposite charge, inside its orbit ( देखिए Gauss 's law ).
In Thomson 's model, electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions between the electrons, and spectra were to be accounted लिये by energy differences of different ring orbits.
Thomson attempted to make his model account for some of the major spectral lines known लिये some elements, but was not notably successful at this.
Still, Thomson 's model ( along with a similar Saturnian रिंग model for atomic electrons, also put forward in 1904 by nagaoka after James Clerk Maxwell 's model of Saturn 's rings ), were earlier harbingers of the later and more successful solar-system-like Bohr model of the atom.
Typical strip of bacon.
Bacon is a cured meat prepared from a pig.
It is first cured using large quantities of salt, either in a brine or in a dry packing ; the result is fresh bacon ( also known as green bacon ).
Fresh bacon may then be further dried for weeks or months in cold air, or it may be boiled or smoked.
Fresh and dried bacon is typically cooked before खाने.
boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some स्मोक्ड bacon, but may be cooked further पहले eating.
Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat.
It is usually made from side and back cuts of pork, except in the United States, where it is almost always prepared from pork belly ( typically referred to as `` streaky '', `` fatty '', or `` American style '' outside of the US and Canada ).
The side cut has more meat and less fat than the belly.
Bacon may be prepared इससे either of two distinct back cuts : fatback, which is almost pure fat, and pork loin, जिससे is very lean.
Bacon-cured pork loin is known as back bacon.
Uncooked pork belly bacon strips.
Bacon may be eaten स्मोक्ड, boiled, fried, baked, or grilled, or used as a minor ingredient to flavor dishes.
Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, e.g. venison, pheasant.
The word is derived from the Old High German bacho, अर्थ `` buttock '', `` ham '' or `` side of bacon '', और cognate with the Old French bacon.
In continental Europe, this part of the pig is usually not smoked like bacon is in the United States ; it is used primarily in cubes ( lardons ) as a cooking ingredient, valued both as a source of fat and for its flavor.
In इटली, this is called pancetta and is usually cooked in small cubes or served uncooked and thinly sliced as part of an antipasto.
Meat from other पशु, such as beef, मेमने, chicken, बकरी, or turkey, may also be cut, cured, or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon, and may भी be referred to as `` bacon ''.
Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations.
The USDA defines bacon as `` the cured belly of a स्वाइन carcass '' ; other cuts and characteristics जरूर be separately qualified ( e.g., `` smoked pork loin bacon '' ).
For safety, bacon must be treated to prevent trichinosis, caused by Trichinella, a parasitic roundworm which can be destroyed by heating, freezing, drying, or smoking.
Bacon is distinguished from नमक pork and ham by differences in the brine ( or dry packing ).
Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably sodium nitrite, and occasionally sodium नाइट्रेट or potassium nitrate ( saltpeter ) ; sodium ascorbate or erythorbate are added to accelerate curing and stabilize color.
Flavorings such as brown sugar or maple are used for some products.
If used, sodium polyphosphates are added to improve sliceability and reduce spattering जब the bacon is pan fried.
Today, a brine for ham, but not bacon, includes a large amount of sugar.
Historically, `` ham '' and `` bacon '' referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in the same barrel.
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ) (, codified in part at ) is a संघीय विधि which establishes minimum standards लिये pension plans in private industry and provides for extensive rules on the federal income tax effects of transactions associated with employee benefit plans.
ERISA was enacted to protect the interests of employee benefit plan participants and their beneficiaries by:
Requiring the disclosure of financial and other information concerning the plan to beneficiaries ;
Establishing standards of conduct for plan fiduciaries ;
Providing for appropriate remedies and access to the federal courts.
ERISA is sometimes used to refer to the full body of laws regulating employee benefit plans, which are found mainly in the Internal Revenue कोड and ERISA itself.
Responsibility for the interpretation and enforcement of ERISA is divided among the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury ( particularly the Internal Revenue Service ), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
Illegal immigration to the United States is the act of foreign nationals entering the United States, without सरकारी permission and in violation of United States nationality law, or staying beyond the termination date of a visa, also in violation of the law.

in human anatomy, the ulnar nerve is a nerve which runs near the ulna bone.
The ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint is in relation with the ulnar nerve.
the तंत्रिका is the largest unprotected nerve in the human देह ( meaning unprotected by muscle or अस्थि ), so injury is common.
This nerve is directly connected to the little उंगली, and the adjacent half of the ring finger, supplying the palmar side of these fingers, including both front और back of the tips, शायद as far back as the fingernail beds.
एक method of injuring the nerve is to strike the medial epicondyle of the humerus from posteriorly, or inferiorly with the elbow flexed.
The ulnar nerve is trapped between the bone and the overlying skin at this point.
इस is commonly referred to as bumping one 's `` funny bone ''.
This name is thought to be a pun, based on the sound resemblance between the name of the bone of the upper arm, the `` humerus `` and the word `` humorous ``.
Alternatively, according to the Oxford English Dictionary it may refer to `` the peculiar sensation experienced when it is struck ''.
Hogwarts स्कूल of Witchcraft and Wizardry, shortened Hogwarts, is a fictional British school of magic for students aged eleven to eighteen, and is the primary setting for the पहला six books in J.K. Rowling 's Harry Potter series.
Rowling has suggested that she may have inadvertently taken the name from the hogwort plant ( Croton capitatus ), which she had seen at Kew Gardens some time before writing the series, हालांकि the names `` The Hogwarts '' and `` Hoggwart '' appear in the 1954 Nigel Molesworth book How To Be Topp by Geoffrey Willans.
Hogwarts school was voted as the 36th best स्कॉटिश educational establishment in a 2008 online ranking, outranking Edinburgh 's Loretto School.
According to a director of the Independent Schools Network Rankings, it was added to the schools listing `` for fun '' and was then voted on.
The U.S. subprime mortgage संकट was a नियत of events and conditions that led to a financial crisis and subsequent recession कि began in 2008.
It was characterized by a rise in subprime mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, and the resulting decline of securities backed by said mortgages.
अनेक major financial institutions collapsed in September 2008, with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recession.
There were many causes of the crisis, with commentators assigning different levels of blame to financial institutions, regulators, credit agencies, सरकारी housing policies, and consumers, among others.
A proximate cause was the rise in subprime lending.
The percentage of lower-quality subprime mortgages originated during a given year rose from the historical 8 % or lower range to approximately 20 % from 2004 to 2006, with much higher ratios in some parts of the U.S.
A high percentage of these subprime mortgages, over 90 % in 2006 लिये example, were adjustable-rate mortgages.
These two changes were part of a broader trend of lowered lending standards and higher-risk mortgage products.
Further, U.S. households had become increasingly indebted, with the ratio of debt to disposable personal income rising इससे 77 % in 1990 to 127 % at the end of 2007, much of this increase mortgage-related.
When U.S. home prices declined steeply बाद peaking in mid-2006, borrowers ' क्षमता to refinance their loans became more difficult.
As adjustable-rate mortgages began to reset at higher interest rates ( causing higher monthly payments ), mortgage delinquencies soared.
Securities backed with mortgages, including subprime mortgages, widely held by वित्तीय firms globally, lost most of their value.
Global investors also drastically reduced purchases of mortgage-backed debt and other securities as part of a मनाही in the capacity और willingness of the private financial system to support lending.
Concerns about the soundness of U.S. credit and financial markets led to tightening credit around the world and slowing economic growth in the U.S. and Europe.
The crisis had severe, long-lasting consequences for the U.S. and European economies.
The u.S. entered a deep recession, साथ nearly 9 लाख कार्य lost during 2008 and 2009, roughly 6 % of the workforce.
u.S. housing prices fell nearly 30 % on average and the U.S. stock market fell approximately 50 % by early 2009.
As of early 2013, the U.S. stock मार्केट had recovered to its pre-crisis peak but housing prices remained near their low पाइंट and unemployment remained elevated.
Economic growth remained below pre-crisis levels.
Europe also continued to struggle with its own economic crisis.
Carl Jung in 1910.
Myers and Briggs extrapolated उनके MBTI theory from जंग 's writings in his किताब Psychological Types.
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI ) assessment is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and मेक निर्णय.
These preferences were extrapolated from the typological theories proposed by Carl Gustav Jung और first प्रकाशित in उसके 1921 book Psychological Types ( English edition, 1923 ).
Jung theorized that there are four principal psychological functions by which we experience the world : sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking.
One of these four functions is dominant most of the time.
the असली developers of the personality inventory were katharine Cook Briggs और उसके daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers ; these two, having studied extensively the work of Jung, turned their interest of human behavior into a devotion of turning the theory of मनोवैज्ञानिक types to practical use.
They began creating the indicator during World War II, believing कि a ज्ञान of personality preferences would सहायता women जो यहूद entering the industrial workforce for the first time to identify the sort of war-time jobs that होता be `` most comfortable and effective ''.
The initial questionnaire grew into the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which was first published in 1962.
The MBTI focuses on normal populations and emphasizes the मान of naturally occurring differences.
Robert Kaplan and डेनिस Saccuzzo believe `` the underlying assumption of the MBTI is that we all have specific preferences in the way we construe our experiences, and these preferences underlie our रूचि, needs, values, and motivation '' ( p. 499 ).
`` Judas '' is a song by American recording artist Lady गागा, from her second studio album Born This Way ( 2011 ).
It was released by Interscope Records on April 15, 2011, four days ahead of its scheduled release.
Written and produced by महिला Gaga and RedOne, `` यहूदा '' is a dance and electro house सोंग about a woman in प्रेम with a man who betrayed her.
it embodies the incidents that have haunted Gaga in the past, and its core meaning refers to the negative parts of her life that she ca n't escape.
गागा has further explained that the song was also about honoring one 's inner darkness in order to bring oneself into the light.
The artwork for the single was designed by Gaga in Microsoft शब्द.
In spite of a polarizing impact on several religious groups, the song was generally well प्राप्त by critics, who likened the song to `` Bad Romance `` with some noting it should have been the album 's lead single.
the song has a similar sound to Gaga 's previous RedOne-produced tracks, including `` Poker Face ``, `` LoveGame ``, `` Bad Romance '', and `` Alejandro ``.
It contains three distinct hooks और a house -influenced break down.
Gaga समझाया that the lines spoken during the breakdown talk about her as beyond redemption, regarding the traditional views of what a woman should be.
`` Judas '' initially had a strong sales opening, but was less successful commercially in comparison to Gaga 's previous singles.
The song reached the top ten of the चार्ट in most major music markets, and भी reached the top of the charts in South Korea.
A music video for the song was filmed in April 2011, co-directed by Gaga and laurieann Gibson and co-starring Norman Reedus.
it has a Biblical storyline where Reedus played Judas इस्कैरियट और Gaga played Mary Magdalene.
The video portrays them as आधुनिक day missionaries going to Jerusalem.
It included the Biblical story of Judas betraying Jesus, and ended with Gaga as Magdalene getting stoned to death.
Before its release, the Catholic League condemned Gaga for the alleged use of religious imagery and her role in the video.
However, आलोचकों generally praised the video, नहीं finding any offensive content.
The video was मनोनीत for two पुरस्कार at the 2011 एमटीवी Video Music पुरस्कार.
Gaga has performed `` Judas '' on a number of television shows, सहित The Graham Norton दिखाएँ, Saturday Night Live, Good morning Americas `` Summer Concert Series '', the फ्रेंच X Factor as well as on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.
Marvin Gaye ( April 2, 1939April 1, 1984 ), born Marvin Pentz Gay, Jr., was an American singer-songwriter और musician.

During the 1970s, Gaye recorded the concept albums What 's going On and Let 's Get It On and became among the first artists in Motown to break away from the reins of its production company.
Gaye 's later recordings influenced several R & B subgenres such as quiet storm and neo-soul.
Following a काल in Europe under a कर exile in the early 1980s, Gaye released the 1982 Grammy Award-winning hit `` Sexual Healing `` and the Midnight Love album.

Superannuation in Australia refers to the इंतजाम which people make in Australia to have funds available for them in retirement.
In Australia, superannuation arrangements are government-supported and encouraged, and minimum provisions are अनिवार्य for employees.
For example, employers are required to pay a proportion of an employee 's salaries and wages ( currently 9 % ) into a superannuation fund, but people are encouraged to put aside additional funds into superannuation.
The minimum obligation required by employers is set to increase to 12 % gradually stepping annually from 2013 to 2020.
An individual can withdraw funds out of a superannuation fund when the व्यक्ति meets one of the conditions of release contained in Schedule 1 of the Superannuation Industry ( Supervision ) Regulations 1994.

President Barack Obama ( D - IL ) won the popular vote in 26 states and the District of Columbia ( denoted in blue ) to कैप्चर 332 electoral votes.
Former Governor Mitt Romney ( R - MA ) जीती the popular vote in 24 states ( denoted in red ) to capture 206 electoral votes.
Cartogram representation of the Electoral College vote लिये the 2012 election, with each square representing one electoral vote.
The United राज्य Electoral College is the institution कि officially elects the President and Vice President of the United States every four years.
The President and Vice President हैं not elected directly by the voters.
बजाय, they are elected by `` electors '' who are chosen by popular vote on a state-by-state basis.
Electors are apportioned to each state and the District of Columbia, but not to territorial possessions of the United राज्य, such as Puerto Rico and Guam.
The number of electors in each राज्य is बराबर to the number of members of Congress to which the state is entitled.
the Twenty-third Amendment has सदा resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors.
There हैं 538 electors, based on there being 435 representatives and 100 senators, plus the three electors from the District of Columbia.
निर्वाचक are pledged to particular presidential and vice presidential candidates, though unpledged electors are possible.
In all states, except Maine and Nebraska, electors are elected on a `` winner-take-all '' आधार.
That is, all electors pledged to the presidential candidate who wins the most votes in a राज्य become electors for that राज्य.
Maine and Nebraska use the `` congressional district method '', selecting one elector भीतर each congressional district by popular vote and selecting the बाकी two electors by a statewide popular vote.
Although no elector is required by federal law to honor a pledge, there have only been very few occasions जब an elector voted contrary to a pledge.
The Twelfth Amendment specifies how a President and Vice President are elected and requires each elector to cast one vote for President and another vote for Vice अध्यक्ष.
Critics argue that the Electoral College is inherently undemocratic and gives swing states disproportionate influence in electing the President and Vice President.
The Electoral College gives a numeric advantage in the election of the president to the smaller states, as the minimum number of electors for the small states is three compared to एक for the election of प्रतिनिधि.

The Plymouth Superbird is प्रसिद्ध for its extremely high rear wing.
1987 Audi Sport QuattroS1 with its large wings at Pikes Peak
A spoiler is an automotive aerodynamic device जिनकी intended design function is to 'spoil ' unfavorable air movement across a body of a vehicle in motion, usually described as turbulence or drag.
Spoilers on the front of a vehicle are often called air dams, because in जोड to directing air प्रवाह they also reduce the amount of air flowing underneath the गाडी which generally reduces aerodynamic lift and खीचें.
Spoilers हैं often fitted to race and high-performance sports cars, although they have become common on यात्री वाहनों as well.
Some spoilers are added to cars primarily for styling purposes and have either little aerodynamic benefit or even मेक the aerodynamics worse.
Spoilers for cars are often incorrectly confused साथ, or the term used interchangeably with, wings.
Automotive wings हैं devices whose intended design is to generate downforce as air passes around them, not simply disrupt existing airflow patterns.

A plaque commemorating the location of the Sarajevo assassination ( image taken in 2009 )
On 28 जून 1914, Archduke फ्रांज Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were shot dead in Sarajevo, by Gavrilo Princip, एक of a group of six Bosnian serb assassins coordinated by Danilo Ilić.
The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary 's south-Slav प्रांतों so वे could be combined into a Greater Serbia or a Yugoslavia.
The assassins ' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia.
Serbian military officers stood behind the attack.
At the top of these Serbian military conspirators थी Chief of Serbian Military प्रज्ञा Dragutin Dimitrijević, his righthand man प्रमुख Vojislav Tankosić, and Masterspy Rade malobabić.
Major Tankosić armed the assassins साथ bombs और pistols and trained them.
The assassins were given access to the same clandestine tunnel of safe-houses and agents that rade Malobabić used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary.
The assassins, the key members of the clandestine tunnel, and the key Serbian military षड्यंत्रकारियों who were still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished.
Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914.
The other conspirators यहूद arrested and tried before a Serbian kangaroo court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false आरोप ; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators.
Much of what is ज्ञात about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records.
Assignment of जिम्मेदारी for the bombing and murders of 28 June is highly controversial because the attack led to the outbreak of World War I one month later.
Mission San Juan Capistrano was a Spanish mission in Southern कैलिफ़ोर्निया, located in present-day San Juan Capistrano.
It was founded on All Saints ' Day November 1, 1776, by Spanish Catholics of the Franciscan Order.
Named for Giovanni da Capistrano, a 15th century theologian and `` warrior priest '' who resided in the Abruzzo region of Italy, San Juan Capistrano has the distinction of being home to the oldest building in California still in use, a chapel built in 1782.
Known alternately as `` सेरा 's Chapel '' and `` Father Serra 's Church, '' it is the only extant structure where it has been documented कि the padre Junipero Serra celebrated mass.
One of the best known of the Alta California missions ( and one of the few missions to have actually been founded twice—others being Mission सैन Gabriel Arcángel और Mission la Purísima Concepción ).
The site was originally consecrated on October 30, 1775, by Father Fermín Lasuén, but was quickly abandoned due to unrest among the indigenous population in San Diego.
The success of the settlement is evident in its historical records.
Prior to the arrival of the missionaries, some 550 natives were scattered throughout the local area.
By 1790, the number of converted Christians had grown to 700, and just six years later nearly 1,000 `` neophytes `` ( recent converts ) lived in or around the Mission यौगिक.
1,649 baptisms were conducted that year अलोन, आउट of the कुल 4,639 souls converted between 1776 and 1847.
More than 2,000 former inhabitants ( mostly Juaneño Indians ) are दफ्न in unmarked graves in the Mission 's cemetery ( campo santo ).
The remains of Father ( later Monsignor ) St. John o'sullivan, who recognized the प्रॉपर्टी 's historic value and working tirelessly to conserve and rebuild its structures, are buried at the entrance to the cemetery on the west side of the property, and a statue raised in his honor stands at the head of the crypt.
The surviving chapel also serves as the final resting place of three padres who passed on while serving at the Mission : Fathers José Barona, Vicente Fustér, and Vicente Pascual Oliva are all entombed beneath the अभयारण्य floor.
The Criolla or `` मिशन grape, '' was first planted at San Juan Capistrano in 1779 ; in 1783, the first wine produced in Alta California emerged from the Mission 's winery.
The Mission entered a long period of gradual मनाही after secularization in 1833.
Numerous efforts were made over the years to restore the Mission to its former महिमा, but none met with great success until the arrival of Father O'Sullivan in 1910.
Restoration efforts continue, and `` Serra 's Chapel '' is still used for religious services.
About half-a-million visitors, including 80,000 school children, come to the Mission प्रत्येक year.
And while the ruins of `` The ग्रेट Stone गिरिजाघर '' ( which was सब but leveled by an 1812 earthquake ) are a renowned architectural wonder, the Mission is perhaps best known for the annual `` वापसी of the Swallows '' जिससे is traditionally observed every March 19 ( Saint Joseph 's Day ).
Mission San Juan Capistrano has परोसा as a favorite subject for many notable artists, and has been immortalized in literature and on film numerous times, perhaps more than any अन्य mission.
In 1984, a modern church complex was constructed just north and west of the Mission compound और is now known as Mission Basilica San Juan capistrano.
Today, the mission compound serves as a museum, with the Serra Chapel within the compound serving as a chapel for the mission parish.

Mercedes-Benz Superdome ( originally Louisiana Superdome and commonly The Superdome ) is a sports and प्रदर्शनी stadium, located in the सेंट्रल Business ज़िला of New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.
Plans were drawn up in 1967, by the New Orleans modernist architectural firm of Curtis and Davis.
Its steel frame covers a expanse.
Its dome is made of a Lamella multi-ringed frame and has a diameter of, making it the largest fixed domed structure in the world.
It is home to the NFL 's New Orleans Saints, the NCAA 's Division I-A Tulane Green Wave football team ( the largest football स्टेडियम in सम्मेलन USA ), the राज्य Farm Bayou क्लासिक, the R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl, the Allstate Sugar Bowl and, every fourth year, the BCS National Championship Game.
Because of the size and location in one of the major tourist destinations in the United States, the Superdome routinely makes the `` short list '' of candidates being considered for major sporting कार्यक्रम, such as the Super Bowl और the Final Four.
In 2005, the Superdome gained international attention of a different type when it housed thousands of people seeking shelter from Hurricane Katrina.
The building suffered extensive damage as a result of the storm, and was closed for अनेक months afterward.
On October 3, 2011, it was announced that German automaker Mercedes-Benz purchased naming rights to the stadium.
The new नाम took प्रभाव on October 23, 2011.
It is the third stadium that has naming rights from Mercedes-Benz ( and first in the United States ), after the Mercedes-Benz Arena, the stadium of Bundesliga क्लबों VfB Stuttgart, in stuttgart, Germany and the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai, China.

The People 's Party, also known as the `` populists '', was a short-lived राजनैतिक party in the United States established in 1891 during the Populist movement ( United States, 19th Century ).
it थी most important in 1892-96, and then rapidly धुंधली away.
Based among ग़रीब, white cotton farmers in the South ( especially North Carolina, Alabama, and Texas ) and hard-pressed wheat farmers in the plains states ( especially Kansas and Nebraska ), it represented a radical crusading form of agrarianism और hostility to banks, railroads, and elites generally.
It sometimes formed coalitions with labor unions, and in 1896 the Democrats endorsed their अध्यक्षीय nominee, William Jennings Bryan.
The terms `` populist '' and `` populism `` are commonly used for anti-elitist appeals in opposition to established interests and mainstream parties.
Linguistic map of Nigeria, Cameroon, and Benin.
Sign in English, outside the विश्वविद्यालयों of Lagos
There are hundreds of languages spoken in Nigeria.
The major languages are Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo, Edo, Fulfulde, Kanuri, and ibb.
the official भाषा of Nigeria, English, the पूर्व colonial भाषा, was chosen to सुकर the cultural and linguistic unity of the country.
English, however, remains an exclusive preserve of the country 's urban elite, and is not widely spoken in rural areas, which comprise three quarters of the countries population.
Nigeria 's linguistic diversity is a microcosm of Africa as a whole, encompassing three major African languages families : Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan, and Niger–Congo.
Nigeria also has several as-yet unclassified languages, such as Cen Tuum, which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families.
A series of events led to the attack on Pearl Harbor.
War between Japan and the United States had been a सम्भावना that each nation 's military forces planned for since the 1920s, हालांकि real टेंशन did नहीं begin until the 1931 invasion of Manchuria by Japan.
over the अगला decade, Japan expanded slowly into China, leading to all out war between the two in 1937.
In 1940 Japan invaded French Indochina in an प्रयत्न to embargo all imports into चीन, including युद्ध supplies खरीदा from the U.S.
This move prompted the संयुक्त States to embargo all आयल निर्यात, leading the Imperial Japanese Navy to estimate that it था less than two सालो of बंकर आयल remaining and to support the existing योजनाएँ to seize oil resources in the Dutch East Indies.
Planning had been underway for some time on an attack on the `` Southern Resource Area '' to add it to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere that Japan envisioned in the Pacific.
The Philippine islands, at that time an American territory, were also a Japanese निशाना.
The Japanese military concluded that an invasion of the Philippines would provoke an American military response.
Rather than seize and fortify the islands, and wait for the inevitable us counterattack, Japan 's सैन्य leaders instead decided on the pre-emptive Pearl हार्बर attack, which they assumed would negate the American forces needed for the liberation and reconquest of the islands.
Planning for the attack had begun in very जल्दी 1941, by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.
He finally won assent from the Naval High Command by, among other things, threatening to resign.
The attack was approved in the summer at an Imperial Conference and again at a second Conference in the fall.
simultaneously over the year, pilots were trained, and ships prepared for its execution.
Authority लिये the attack was granted at the second इम्पीरियल Conference if a diplomatic result satisfactory to Japan was नहीं reached.
After final approval by सम्राट Hirohito the order to attack was issued at the beginning of December.
A common office stapler
A common school stapler
A stapler is a mechanical device that joins sheets of paper or similar material by ड्राइविंग a thin metal स्टेपल through the sheets and फोल्डिंग the ends.
Staplers are widely used in government, business, offices, homes and schools.
The word `` stapler '' can actually refer to a number of different devices of varying uses.
In जोड to joining paper sheets together, staplers can also be used in a surgical setting to join tissue together साथ surgical staples to close a surgical wound ( much in the same way as stitches or sutures ).
Typically, most staplers are प्रयुक्त to join multiple sheets of paper.
Paper staplers come in two distinct types : manual and electric.
Manual staplers are normally hand-held, although models that are used while set on a desk or other surface are not uncommon.
Electric staplers exist in a किस्में of different डिजाइन and models.
Their primary ऑपरेटिंग function is to join large numbers of paper sheets together in rapid succession.
Some electric staplers can join up to 20 sheets at a time.
Swallowing, known scientifically as deglutition, is the process in the human or animal body that makes something pass from the mouth, to the pharynx, and into the esophagus, जबकि shutting the epiglottis.
If this fails and the object goes through the trachea, then choking or pulmonary aspiration can occur.
In the human body it is controlled by the swallowing reflex.
Thaddeus Stevens ( अप्रैल 4, 1792 – August 11, 1868 ), of Pennsylvania, was a leader of the Radical Republican faction of the Republican Party and a fierce प्रतिद्वन्दी of slavery.
he was one of the most influential सदस्यों in the history of Congress.
as chairman of the powerful House तरीके and Means कमेटी, Stevens, a witty, sarcastic speaker and flamboyant party leader, dominated the House from 1861 until his death.
He wrote much of the financial विधान that सशुल्क for the American Civil War.
Stevens and Senator Charles Sumner were the prime नेताओ of the Radical Republicans दौरान the war and Reconstruction era.
Scholarly views of Stevens have swung sharply since his death as interpretations of Reconstruction have changed.
इतिहासकारों of the Dunning School ( 1890s–1940s ) आयोजित Stevens responsible for demanding harsh उपचार of the white South and violating अमरीकी परंपराओं of republicanism, depicting Stevens as a villain for his advocacy of harsh measures in the South such as disfranchising all ex-confederates.
This अत्यधिक negative characterization held sway into the 1950s.
The rise of the neo-abolitionist school in the 1950s led to a strong positive appreciation of Stevens ' work on सिविल rights for Freedmen.
A recent biographer characterizes उसे as, `` The Great Commoner, savior of free public शिक्षा in Pennsylvania, national Republican leader in the struggles against slavery in the United राज्य and intrepid mainstay of the attempt to secure racial justice लिये the Freedmen during Reconstruction, the तभी member of the House of Representatives ever to have महरूम known as the 'dictator ' of कॉंग्रेस.

Overview of the translation of eukaryotic मेसेंजर rna
Diagram showing the translation of mRNA and the synthesis of proteins by a ribosome
In molecular biology and genetics, translation is the process through which cellular ribosomes manufacture proteins.
It is part of the process of gene expression.
In translation, मेसेंजर RNA ( mRNA ) produced by transcription is decoded by the ribosome to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide, that will बाद fold into an active protein.
in bacteria, अनुवाद occurs in the cell 's cytoplasm, where the large and small subunits of the ribosome are located, और bind to the mRNA.
In eukaryotes, translation occurs across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in a process called vectorial synthesis.
The ribosome facilitates डिकोडिंग by inducing the binding of tRNAs with complementary anticodon sequences to that of the mRNA.
The trnas carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is `` read '' by the ribosome in a fashion reminiscent to that of a stock ticker and ticker tape.
In many instances, the entire ribosome/mRNA complex binds to the outer membrane of the अशिष्ट endoplasmic reticulum and releases the nascent protein polypeptide inside लिये later vesicle transport and secretion outside of the cell.
Many types of transcribed RNA, such as transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and small नाभिकीय RNA, do not undergo translation into proteins.
Translation proceeds in four phases : initiation, elongation, translocation and termination ( all describing the growth of the amino acid chain, or polypeptide that is the उत्पाद of translation ).
Amino acids are brought to ribosomes and assembled into proteins.
In activation, the correct amino acid is covalently bonded to the correct transfer RNA ( tRNA ).
the अमीनो acid is joined by its carboxyl group to the 3 ' OH of the tRNA by an ester bond.
When the tRNA has an अमीनो acid linked to it, it is termed `` charged ''.
दीक्षा involves the small subunit of the ribosome binding to the 5 ' end of mRNA with the help of initiation factors ( IF ).
Termination of the polypeptide happens when the A site of the ribosome faces a stop codon ( UAA, UAG, or UGA ).
No trna can recognize or bind to this codon.
Instead, the stop codon induces the binding of a release factor प्रोटीन that prompts the disassembly of the entire ribosome/mRNA complex.
a number of antibiotics act by inhibiting translation ; these include anisomycin, cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, and puromycin, among others.
prokaryotic ribosomes have a different structure इससे that of eukaryotic ribosomes, और thus antibiotics can specifically target bacterial infections without any detriment to a eukaryotic host 's cells.
A multimedia message on a mobile phone.
Multimedia Messaging सेवा ( MMS ) is a मानक way to send messages that include मल्टीमीडिया content to and from mobile phones.
It extends the core SMS ( छोटी Message सेवा ) capability that अनुमत एक्सचेंज of text messages only up to 160 characters in लंबाई.
The most popular use is to send photographs from camera-equipped handsets, although it is also popular as a method of delivering news and entertainment content including videos, pictures, text pages and ringtones.
The standard is विकसित by the Open मोबाईल Alliance ( OMA ), although during development it was part of the 3gpp and WAP groups.
Smallpox was an infectious disease unique to humans, caused by either of two virus variants, Variola major and Variola minor.
The disease is also known by the Latin names Variola or Variola vera, derived from varius ( `` spotted '' ) or varus ( `` pimple '' ).
The disease was originally known in English as the `` pox '' or `` red plague '' ; the term `` smallpox '' was first प्रयुक्त in Britain in the 15th century to distinguish variola इससे the `` great pox '' ( syphilis ).
The last naturally occurring case of smallpox ( variola minor ) was diagnosed on 26 October 1977.
Smallpox localized in small blood vessels of the skin and in the mouth and throat.
in the skin it resulted in a characteristic maculopapular rash and, later, raised fluid-filled blisters.
V. major produces a more serious disease and has an overall mortality rate of 30–35 %.
V. minor causes a milder form of disease ( also known as alastrim, cottonpox, milkpox, whitepox, and Cuban itch ) जिससे kills about 1 % of its victims.
long-term complications of V. major infection include characteristic scars, commonly on the face, which occur in 65–85 % of survivors.
Blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring, and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis are less common complications, seen in about 2–5 % of cases.
Smallpox is believed to have emerged in human populations about 10,000 BC.
The earliest शारीरिक evidence of it is probably the pustular rash on the mummified body of Pharaoh Ramses V of Egypt.
The disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans annually दौरान the closing years of the 18th सदी ( including five reigning monarchs ), and was responsible लिये a third of all blindness.
of all those infected, 20–60 % —and over 80 % of infected children—died from the disease.
Smallpox was responsible for an estimated 300–500 million मौतों during the 20th century.
As recently as 1967, the World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimated that 15 लाख people contracted the disease और that two million died in that year.
बाद टीकाकरण campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the WHO certified the eradication of smallpox in 1979.
Smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated, the other होने rinderpest, which was declared eradicated in 2011.
`` I Want to Hold Your हाथ '' is a song by the English rock बैंड the Beatles.
Written by John Lennon and पॉल McCartney, and recorded in October 1963, it was the first Beatles record to be made using four-track equipment.
With advance orders exceeding one लाख copies in the United Kingdom, `` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' would ordinarily have gone straight to the top of the British रिकार्ड charts on its day of release ( 29 November 1963 ) had it not been blocked by the group 's first million seller `` She Loves You ``, the Beatles ' previous UK सिंगल, which was having a resurgent spell in the top position following तीव्र media coverage of the group.
Taking two weeks to dislodge its predecessor, `` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' stayed at number एक for five weeks and remained in the UK top fifty for twenty-one weeks in total.
It was भी the group 's first American number one, entering the Billboard Hot 100 chart on 18 January 1964 at number forty-five and starting the British invasion of the American music industry.

`` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' became the Beatles ' best-selling single worldwide.
a gasser was a type of hot rod originating on the dragstrips of the United States in the late 1950s and continued until the जल्दी 1970s.
gassers were आधारित on उत्पादन models from the 1930s to mid-1960s, which have been stripped of extraneous weight and jacked up using a truck beam धुरी to provide better weight वितरण on acceleration ( Beam axles are also lighter than an independent front suspension ), though a raised stock front suspension is common as well.
Common weight reduction techniques include fiberglass body panels, stripped interiors और plexiglass windows ( sometimes color tinted ).
Because they were primarily built लिये रेसिंग, these cars typically had the engine swapped to a larger or more powerful one, the मौजूदा stock इंजन modified ( often heavily ) or both.
It थी very common to fit a जड़ें supercharger and mechanical fuel injection, such as one from Algon, Hilborn, or crower.
With form being dictated by function, their रूप is often very top भारी and ungainly, largely due to front ends being raised उच्चतर than stock, to assist in the weight ट्रांसफ़र during rapid acceleration ( racing ).
Having their exhaust pipes exit through the front fender well is a common characteristic of gassers, as is having bodies painted in flamboyant metalflakes, pearls, and candy finishes complemented by lettering in wild फ़ॉन्ट्स.
The name arose because they competed in a gasoline -fueled drag racing class, rather than one using methanol or nitromethane.
The gasser is the predecessor of the modern Funny Car.
Twelve-lead EKG of a 26-year-old male
Electrocardiography ( ECG or EKG from ) is a transthoracic ( across the thorax or chest ) interpretation of the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time, as detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and recorded by a device external to the body.
The रिकॉर्डिंग produced by this noninvasive procedure is termed an electrocardiogram ( also ECG or EKG ).
An ECG is used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats, as well as the size and position of the chambers, the presence of any damage to the दिल, and the effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart, such as a pacemaker.

Steam rising इससे the Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station in Iceland.
Geothermal energy is thermal energy generated and stored in the धरती.
Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter.
The Geothermal उर्जा of the Earth 's crust originates from the original गठन of the planet ( 20 % ) and from radioactive decay of minerals ( 80 % ).
The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its सतह, ड्राइव a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface.
The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη ( ge ), meaning earth, और θερμος ( thermos ), meaning hot.
At the core of the Earth, थर्मल energy is created by radioactive decay and temperatures may reach over 5000 °C ( 9,000 °F ).
Heat conducts from the कोर to surrounding कूलर rock.
The high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt, creating magma convection upward since it is lighter than the solid rock.
The मैग्मा heats rock and जल in the crust, sometimes up to 370 °c ( 700 °F ).
From hot springs, geothermal उर्जा has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient रोमन times, but it is now better known for electricity generation.
विश्वव्यापी, about 10,715 megawatts ( MW ) of geothermal power is online in 24 countries.
An additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination और agricultural applications.
Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, चिरस्थायी, और environmentally friendly, but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic थाली boundaries.
Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation.
Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.
As a result, geothermal power has the संभावित to help mitigate वैश्विक warming if widely deployed in place of चट्टान fuels.
the Earth 's geothermal resources are theoretically more than पर्याप्त to supply humanity 's energy needs, लकिन only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited.
Drilling and exploration लिये गहन resources is very expensive.
Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology, energy prices, subsidies, and interest rates.
Pilot programs like EWEB 's customer opt in Green Power Program show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a बेदर्दी energy source like geothermal.
But as a result of government assisted research and industry experience, the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25 % over the पास्ट two decades.
In 2001, geothermal energy cost between two और ten cents per kwh.
Ownership of property may be private, collective, or common और the property may be वस्तुएँ, land/real estate, or intellectual property.
Determining ownership in law involves determining who has certain rights and duties over the property.
These अधिकारों and duties, sometimes called a 'bundle of rights ', can be separated और held by different parties.
The question of स्वामित्व पहुँच back to the ancient philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, who held different opinions on the subject.
प्लेटो ( 428/427 BC – 348/347 BC ) विचार private property created divisive inequalities, while Aristotle ( 384 BC – 322 BC ) thought private प्रॉपर्टी enabled people to receive the full benefit of their labor.
Private property can circumvent what is now referred to as the “ tragedy of the commons ” problem, where people tend to degrade common property more than they do private property.
Given a short-sighted owner, however, a private property system can make these tragedies worse—for example, a private owner of a piece of oil-rich property, depending on his worldview, might be more interested in short-term financial gain than incremental use with an eye toward other 's concerns ( e.g., those of future generations, the disenfranchised, इत्यादि. ).
While Aristotle justified the existence of private ownership, he left open questions of ( 1 ) कैसा to allocate property between what is private and common and ( 2 ) how to allocate the private property within society.
Over the millennia, and across cultures कया can be property and how it is regarded culturally have varied widely.
Ownership is the basis लिये many other concepts that form the foundations of ancient and modern societies such as money, trade, debt, bankruptcy, the criminality of theft, and private vs. public प्रॉपर्टी.
Ownership is the key building block in the development of the capitalist socio-economic प्रणाली.
Adam Smith stated that one of the sacred कानून of इंसाफ was to guard a person 's property and possessions.
The process और mechanics of ownership are fairly complex : one can gain, transfer and खोना ownership of property in a number of ways.
To acquire property one can purchase it साथ money, trade it लिये other property, receive it as a gift, steal it, find it, make, it or homestead it.
One can transfer or lose ownership of property by selling it for money, exchanging it for other प्रॉपर्टी, giving it as a gift, being robbed of it, it, or having it stripped from एक 's ownership through legal means such as eviction, foreclosure, seizure, or taking.
Ownership is self-propagating in that the owner of any property will also own the economic लाभ of that property.

A solstice is an astronomical event कि occurs twice each year as the सूर्य reaches its highest or lowest excursion relative to the celestial equator on the celestial sphere.
As a result, on the day of the solstice, the Sun appears to have reached its highest or lowest annual altitude in the आसमान above the horizon at local solar noon.

The Proclamation did not apply to the five slave states that were नहीं in rebellion, nor to सबसे regions already controlled by the संघ army ; emancipation there would come after separate state actions and/or the December 1865 ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, which made slavery illegal everywhere in the U.S.

Differences with newer antidepressants हैं subtler and also mostly confined to पक्ष effects.
Evidence suggests that sertraline may work better than fluoxetine ( Prozac ) for some subtypes of depression.
Treatment of panic disorder with sertraline results in a significant decrease of the number of panic attacks and in improved quality of life.
For obsessive-compulsive disorder, sertraline is not as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy ; the best results have been achieved by combining these two treatments.
Although approved for social phobia and posttraumatic stress विकार, sertraline leads to तभी modest सुधार in these conditions.
Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently for its treatment.
Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high दरों of मतली, diarrhea, insomnia, and sexual side effects ; however, it करता not cause weight gain, and its effects on both cognition and vigilance are relatively mild.
In गर्भवती women taking sertraline, the drug was present in significant concentrations in fetal blood, and was also associated with a उच्चतर rate of various birth defects.

A typical 12 V, 40 Ah Lead-acid car battery
An automotive battery is a type of rechargeable battery कि supplies electric energy to an automobile.
Usually this refers to an SLI battery ( starting, lighting, ignition ) to power the starter motor, the lights, and the ignition system of a vehicle’s engine.
Automotive SLI batteries are usually lead-acid type, and are made of six galvanic cells in series to provide a 12 volt system.
Each cell provides 2.1 volts for a total of 12.6 volt at full charge.
Heavy vehicles such as highway trucks or tractors, often equipped with diesel engines, may have two batteries in श्रेणी for a 24 वोल्ट system, or may have parallel स्ट्रिंग्स of batteries.
Lead-acid batteries are made up of plates of lead and separate plates of सीसे dioxide, which are submerged into an electrolyte solution of about 38 % sulfuric acid and 62 % water.
This causes a chemical reaction that releases electrons, allowing them to flow through conductors to produce electricity.
As the बैटरी discharges, the acid of the electrolyte प्रतिक्रियाएँ with the materials of the plates, changing their surface to सीसे sulfate.
When the battery is recharged, the chemical reaction is reversed : the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide and lead.
With the plates restored to their original कंडीशन, the process may now be repeated.
Battery recycling of automotive batteries reduces the need for resources required लिये manufacture of new batteries, diverts toxic lead from landfills, and prevents risk of improper disposal.
Full-time employment is employment in which a person works a minimum number of hours पारिभाषित as such by his/her employer.

आंकड़ा Warehouse Overview
In computing, a data warehouse or enterprise data warehouse ( DW, DWH, or EDW ) is a database used for reporting और data analysis.
It is a central repository of आंकड़ा which is created by integrating data from one or more disparate sources.
Data warehouses store current as well as historical data and are used for creating trending reports for senior management रिपोर्टिंग such as annual and quarterly comparisons.
The data stored in the warehouse are uploaded from the operational systems ( such as marketing, sales etc., shown in the figure to the right ).
The data may pass through an operational data store for additional operations before they are used in the DW for reporting.
The typical ETL -based data गोदाम uses staging, data integration, and access layers to house its कुंजी functions.
The staging परत or staging database stores कच्चा data extracted इससे each of the disparate source data systems.
The integration layer integrates the disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer प्रायः storing this transformed data in an operational data store ( ods ) database.
The integrated data are then moved to yet another database, often called the data warehouse database, where the data is arranged into hierarchical समूह often called dimensions and into facts and कुल facts.
The combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes पुकारा a star schema.
The access layer helps users retrieve data.
A data warehouse constructed from an integrated आंकड़ा source systems करता not require ETL, staging databases, or operational data store databases.
The integrated data source प्रणालियों may be considered to be a part of a distributed operational data store layer.
Data संघ methods or data virtualization methods may be प्रयुक्त to access the distributed integrated सोर्स आंकड़ा systems to consolidate and aggregate data directly into the data warehouse database tables.
Unlike the ETL-based data warehouse, the integrated source data systems and the data warehouse are all integrated since there is no transformation of dimensional or reference data.
This एकीकृत data गोदाम architecture supports the drill down from the aggregate data of the data warehouse to the transactional data of the integrated source आंकड़ा प्रणालियों.
Data warehouses can be subdivided into data marts.
Data marts store subsets of data from a warehouse.
This definition of the data warehouse focuses on data storage.
The main source of the data is cleaned, रूपांतरित, cataloged and made available for उपयोग by managers and other business professionals for data mining, online analytical processing, market research and decision support ( Marakas & O'Brien 2009 ).
However, the means to retrieve and analyze data, to extract, transform and load data, and to manage the data dictionary are भी considered essential components of a data warehousing system.
Many references to data warehousing use this broader कॉन्टेक्स्ट.
Thus, an expanded definition for data warehousing includes business intelligence tools, टूल्स to extract, transform and load data into the repository, and tools to manage and retrieve metadata.

Mormons have a health code that eschews alcoholic beverages, tobacco, कॉफी, चाय, and other addictive substances.
They tend to be very family-oriented, and have दमदार connections across generations and with extended family, reflective of their belief कि families can be sealed together beyond मौत and throughout eternity.
Mormons also have a strict law of शुद्धता, requiring abstention from sexual relations outside of marriage and सख्त fidelity भीतर marriage.
Mormons self-identify as ईसाई, though some of their beliefs differ इससे mainstream Christianity.
Mormons believe in the Bible, as well as other books of scripture, such as the Book of Mormon.
They have a unique view of cosmology, and believe कि all people are spirit-children of God.
Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of Jesus Christ, and accepting his atonement through ordinances such as baptism.
They believe that Christ 's church was restored through Joseph Smith, and is guided by जीना prophets and रसूलों.
Central to Mormon faith is the belief that God speaks to his children and answers their prayers.
In financial हिसाब, assets are economic resources.
Anything tangible or intangible that is capable of being owned or controlled to produce मान and that is held to have positive economic value is considered an एसेट.
बस stated, assets represent value of स्वामित्व that can be converted into cash ( although cash itself is also considered an asset ).
The balance sheet of a firm records the monetaryJ.
G. Siegel, N. Dauber & J. K. Shim, `` The Vest Pocket CPA '', Wiley, 2005.There are different methods of assessing the monetary value of the एसेट recorded on the Balance Sheet.
In some cases, the Historical Cost is used ; such that the value of the asset when it was खरीदा in the past is used as the monetary value.
In अन्य instances, the present fair market value of the asset is प्रयुक्त to determine the value shown on the balance चादर.
value of the assets owned by the firm.
It is money and other valuables belonging to an व्यक्तिगत or business.
Two major asset classes हैं ठोस एसेट and intangible assets.
Tangible assets contain various subclasses, including current assets and fixed assets.J.
Downes, J.E. Goodman, `` Dictionary of Finance & Investment Terms '', Baron 's Financial मार्गदर्शिका, 2003 Current assets शामिल inventory, while fixed assets include such items as buildings and equipment.J. Downes, J.E. Goodman, `` Dictionary of Finance & Investment Terms '', सामन्त 's Financial Guides, 2003 ; and J. G. Siegel, N. Dauber & J. K. Shim, `` The Vest Pocket CPA '', Wiley, 2005.
Intangible assets are nonphysical resources and rights that have a मान to the firm because they give the firm some kind of advantage in the market place.
Examples of intangible assets are goodwill, copyrights, trademarks, patents and computer programs, and financial assets, including such items as accounts receivable, bonds and stocks.
A neuron ( or ; also known as a neurone or तंत्रिका cell ) is an electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals.
A chemical सिग्नल occurs via a synapse, a specialized connection with other कोशिकाएं.
न्यूरॉन्स connect to each other to form neural networks.
Neurons are the core components of the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia.
A number of specialized types of neurons exist : संवेदी neurons respond to touch, sound, लाइट and numerous अन्य stimuli affecting cells of the sensory organs that then भेजें signals to the spinal cord and brain.
Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord, cause muscle contractions, and affect glands.
Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord.
A typical neuron possesses a कोशिका body ( often called the soma ), dendrites, and an axon.
Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body, often extending लिये hundreds of micrometres and branching multiple times, giving rise to a जटिल `` dendritic पेड़ ''.
An axon is a special cellular extension that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and ट्रेवल्स for a distance, as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species.
The cell body of a neuron frequently gives वृद्धि to multiple dendrites, but never to more than एक axon, although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates.
At the majority of synapses, signals are sent from the axon of एक neuron to a dendrite of another.
There हैं, however, many exceptions to these rules : neurons that lack dendrites, neurons that have no axon, synapses कि connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite, etc.
All neurons हैं electrically excitable, maintaining voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically चलित ion pumps, which combine with ion channels अंतःस्थापित in the membrane to generate intracellular-versus-extracellular concentration differences of ions ऐसे as sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium.
परिवर्तन in the cross-membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage-dependent आयन channels.
If the voltage परिवर्तन by a large enough amount, an all-or-none electrochemical pulse called an कार्रवाई potential is generated, which travels rapidly along the cell 's axon, and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives.
Neurons do not undergo cell division.
In most cases, neurons are generated by special types of stem cells.
astrocytes, a type of glial cell, have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency.
In humans, neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood—but in two brain areas, the hippocampus and olfactory बल्ब, there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons.
Super Bowl XLIII was an अमरीकी फ़ुटबॉल game between the American Football Conference ( AFC ) champion Pittsburgh Steelers and the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion Arizona Cardinals to decide the National फ़ुटबॉल League ( NFL ) champion for the 2008 season.
The Steelers defeated the Cardinals by the score of 27–23.
The खेल was played on February 1, 2009, at Raymond James Stadium in tampa, Florida.

Pittsburgh, who finished the regular season with a 12–4 रिकार्ड, also जीती their second Super Bowl in four years after winning Super Bowl XL at the end of the 2005 ऋतु.
The Cardinals entered the game seeking उनके first NFL title since 1947, the longest championship drought in the league.
The club became an unexpected winner during the regular season, compiling a 9–7 record, and the playoffs with the aid of सिर coach केन Whisenhunt, who was the Steelers ' offensive coordinator in Super Bowl XL, and the re-emergence of quarterback Kurt Warner, who was the Super कटोरी MVP in Super Bowl XXXIV with his former team, St. लुई Rams.
Pittsburgh jumped to a 17–7 halftime lead, aided by linebacker जेम्स Harrison 's Super Bowl record 100-yard interception return for a touchdown.
Trailing 20–7 at the start of the fourth quarter, Arizona scored 16 unanswered points, including wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald 's 64-yard touchdown रिसेप्शन, to लो the lead with 2:37 remaining in the game.
But the Steelers marched 78 yards to score on wide receiver Santonio Holmes ' 6-yard game-winning touchdown catch with 35 seconds left.
Holmes, जो caught nine passes for 131 गज and a touchdown, including four receptions for 73 yards on that फाइनल game-winning drive, was named Super Bowl MVP.
He became the sixth wide receiver to win the award, और भी was the third Pittsburgh receiver to win the award, following Lynn Swann and Hines Ward.
Despite the global वित्तीय crisis and limited amount of ancillary festivities that are normally held before the game, the NBC टेलीविज़न संजाल ब्रॉडकास्ट attracted an average U.S. audience of 98.7 million viewers, making it the most watched Super Bowl in इतिहास to that पाइंट.
A diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum, showing various properties across the range of frequencies and wavelengths
The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.
The `` electromagnetic spectrum '' of an object has a different अर्थ, and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object.
the इलेक्ट्रोमैग्नेटिक spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern रेडियो communication to gamma विकिरण at the short- wavelength ( high-frequency ) end, thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a भिन्न of the size of an atom.
The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself, while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length, although in principle the spectrum is infinite and continuous.
Most parts of the electromagnetic वर्णक्रम are used in science for spectroscopic and other probing interactions, as ways to study and characterize matter.
In addition, radiation from various parts of the spectrum has found many other उपयोग for communications और निर्माण ( देखिए electromagnetic radiation for अधिक applications ).

Bryophyte is a traditional name प्रयुक्त to refer to all embryophytes ( land plants ) that do not have true vascular tissue and are therefore called ' non-vascular plants '.
Some bryophytes do have specialized tissues for the transport of water ; however since these do नहीं contain lignin, they हैं not considered to be true vascular tissue.
Currently bryophytes are thought not to be a natural or monophyletic group ; however the name is convenient and remains in use as a collective पद for mosses, hornworts, and liverworts.
Bryophytes उपज enclosed reproductive structures ( gametangia and sporangia ), but they produce neither flowers nor seeds, reproducing via spores.
The term bryophyte comes from Greek βρύον, bryon, `` tree-moss, oyster-green '' + φυτόν - phyton `` plant ''.

The Xbox is a video game console manufactured by Microsoft.
It was released on November 15, 2001 in North America, February 22, 2002 in Japan, and कूच 14, 2002 in Australia and Europe.
It was Microsoft 's first foray into the gaming console market.
As part of the sixth-generation of gaming, the Xbox competed with Sony 's PlayStation 2, Sega 's Dreamcast ( which stopped American sales before the Xbox went on sale ), and Nintendo 's gamecube.
The Xbox was the first console offered by an American company after the Atari जैगुआर stopped बिक्री in 1996.
the integrated एक्सबॉक्स Live service शुभारम्भ in November 2002 allowed players to खेल games online with a broadband connection.
It first competed with Dreamcast 's online service but later primarily competed with PlayStation 2 's online service.
Although these two are free while Xbox सजीव required a subscription, as well as broadband-only connection which थी not completely adopted yet, Xbox Live थी a success due to better servers, features such as a दोस्त सूची, and milestone शीर्षक like Halo 2 released in November 2004, which is the best-selling Xbox video game and was by far the most popular online game for years.
एक्सबॉक्स 's successor, the Xbox 360, was launched in नवम्बर 2005.
The Xbox was discontinued in late 2005 in जापानी where sales were poor.
It was discontinued in late 2006 in Europe and early 2007 in North America.
the last Xbox game in Europe was Tony हॉक 's Project 8 released in November 2006, and the last game in North अमेरिका थी Madden एनएफएल 09 released in August 2008.
Support for out-of-warranty Xbox consoles was discontinued on March 2, 2009, stating that any in-warranty repair अभी needed will not be undertaken.
Xbox access to एक्सबॉक्स Live was stopped on April 15, 2010.
The Gospel According to जॉन ( Greek τὸ κατὰ Ἰωάννην εὐαγγέλιον ), commonly referred to as the इन्जील of John or simply John and often referred to in New Testament scholarship as the Fourth Gospel, is an account of the public मंत्रालय of Jesus.
It begins with the witness and affirmation by John the Baptist and concludes with the मौत, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus.
This account is fourth of the canonical gospels, after the synoptics Matthew, चिह्नित and Luke.
राज्य that the book derives from the testimony of the ' disciple whom Jesus loved. '
Along with Peter, the unnamed disciple is विशेषकर close to Jesus, and early-church tradition identified him as John the Apostle, one of Jesus ' Twelve Apostles.
The gospel is closely related in style and content to the three surviving Epistles of John such that टीकाकारों treat the four books together, yet, according to most modern scholars, John थी not the author of any of these books.
Recent Christian Scripture scholarship more and more has placed John within a first-century Jewish context.
Raymond E. भूरा किया pioneering work to trace the development of the tradition from which the gospel arose.
The discourses seem to be concerned with the actual मुद्दे of the church-and-synagogue debate at the time जब the Gospel was written.
It is notable that, in the gospel, the community still appears to define itself primarily against Judaism, rather than as part of a wider Christian church.
Though Christianity started as a movement within Judaism, gradually Christians and Jews became bitterly opposed.
जॉन presents a `` higher '' Christology than the synoptics, meaning that it describes Jesus as the अवतार of the divine Logos through whom all बाते यहूद made, as the object of veneration, and more explicitly as God incarnate.
Only in John does Jesus talk at length about himself and his divine भूमिका, often shared with the शिष्यों only.
Against the synoptics, John focuses largely on different miracles ( including resurrecting Lazarus ), दिए as signs meant to engender faith.
Synoptic elements ऐसे as parables and exorcisms are not found in जॉन.
It presents a realized eschatology in which salvation is already present for the believer.
The Plagues of Egypt ( ), also called the Ten Plagues ( ) or the Biblical plagues, were ten calamities that, according to the biblical Book of Exodus, Israel 's God, Yahweh, inflicted upon मिश्र to persuade Pharaoh to release the ill-treated israelites from slavery.
Pharaoh capitulated बाद the tenth प्लेग, triggering the Exodus of the Jewish people.
The plagues were designed to कंट्रास्ट the power of Yahweh with the impotence of Egypt 's विभिन्न gods.
Some commentators have associated several of the plagues with judgment on specific gods associated साथ the Nile, fertility और natural phenomena.
the plagues of Egypt are also mentioned in the Quran ( 7,133–136 ).
According to the Book of Exodus, God proclaims that all the gods of Egypt will be judged through the tenth and final plague:

A role-playing game ( RPG and sometimes roleplaying game ) is a game in जिससे खिलाड़ी assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting.
Players take responsibility for acting out ये भूमिकाएँ within a narrative, either through शाब्दिक acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character विकास.
Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal प्रणाली of rules and guidelines.
वहीँ are several forms of RPG.
The original form, sometimes called the tabletop RPG, is conducted through discussion, whereas in live action role-playing games ( LARP ) players physically perform their characters ' actions.
In both of these forms, an arranger called a game master ( GM ) usually decides on the rules and setting to be used and acts as referee, while each of the other players plays the role of a single character.
Several varieties of आरपीजी also मौजूद in electronic मीडिया, such as multi-player text-based MUDs and their graphics-based successors, massively multiplayer online role-playing games ( mmorpgs ).
Role-playing games also include single-player offline role-playing video games in which players control a character or team who undertake quests, and may include capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics.
These खेल often share settings and rules साथ tabletop RPGs, but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative storytelling.
Despite this variety of forms, some game forms ऐसे as trading card खेल and wargames that are related to role-playing games may not be included.
Role-playing कार्यकलाप may sometimes be present in such games, लकिन it is not the primary focus.
The term is also sometimes used to describe लिए सिमुलेशन games and exercises used in teaching, training, and अकादमिक research.
The American Civil War ( ACW ), also ज्ञात as the War between the States or simply the Civil War ( see naming ), was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States ( the `` Union '' or the `` North '' ) and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate राज्य of America ( the `` confederacy '' or the `` South '' ).
The war had its origin in the issue of गुलामी, especially the extension of गुलामी into the western territories.
Foreign शक्तियां did not intervene.
बाद four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South 's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national एकता and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began.
In the 1860 presidential election, republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, opposed expanding slavery into United States ' territories.
Lincoln won, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy.
Outgoing Democratic अध्यक्ष James Buchanan और the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal.
Lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would नहीं initiate civil war.
आठ remaining slave states continued to reject calls लिये secession.
Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy.
A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise, and both sides prepared for युद्ध.
The Confederates assumed that यूरोपीय countries were so dependent on `` King Cotton `` कि they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of अमेरिका.
Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate शक्तियां fired upon Fort sumter, a key fort held by Union troops in South कैरोलिना.
Lincoln called लिये each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently, four more slave राज्य joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to ग्यारह.
The Union soon controlled the border states and स्थापित a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy.
The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62.
The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland ( a Union state ) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam, dissuading British intervention.
lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which made ending slavery a युद्ध goal.
To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi नदी.
In 1863, Robert E. Lee 's Confederate incursion उत्तर ended at the Battle of Gettysburg.
Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864.
in the Western Theater, William T. शरमन drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea, destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way.
The Union marshaled the संसाधन and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, और could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond, the Confederate पूंजी.
The defending Confederate army failed, leading to Lee 's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court हाउस on April 9, 1865.
the American Civil War was one of the earliest true औद्योगिक युद्धों.
Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively.
The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed संसार War I.
it remains the deadliest war in American history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties.
Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years बूढ़ा, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40.
The definition of the world 's busiest airport has महरूम specified by the एयरपोर्ट Council International in Geneva, Switzerland.
The ACI defines and measures the following three types of airport traffic:

Cargo traffic : loaded और unloaded freight and mail in metric tonnes
Traffic movements : landings and take-offs of aircraft
World War I ( WWI ) was a global war centred in Europe that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted जबतक 11 November 1918.
It was predominantly called the World War or the Great युद्ध from its occurrence until the start of World War ii in 1939, and the First World War or World War I thereafter.
It involved all the world 's great powers, which were assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( आधारित on the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom, France and Russia ) and the Central Powers ( originally the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary और Italy ; लकिन, as Austria–Hungary had लिया the अप्रिय against the अनुबंध, Italy did not enter into the war ).
These alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy, Japan and the United States joined the Allies, and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers.
Ultimately, more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history.
More than 9 million combatants were killed, largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility.
It was the fifth- deadliest conflict in world history, subsequently paving the way for various political changes, such as revolutions in many of the nations involved.
One of the long-term causes of the युद्ध was the resurgence of imperialism in the foreign policies of the great शक्तियां of Europe.
More immediately, the assassination of Archduke Franz फर्डिनेंड of Austria, the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, on 28 June 1914 by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary subsequently delivered an ultimatum to the किंगडम of Serbia.
Several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked.
भीतर सप्ताह, the प्रमुख powers were at war and, via their colonies, the conflict soon स्प्रेड around the world.
On 28 जुलाई, the Austro-Hungarians fired the first shots of the war as preparation लिये the invasion of Serbia.
While the Russians mobilised, the Germans invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg on the way to France, providing a casus belli for Britain 's declaration of war against Germany.
After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt—the so-called Miracle of the Marne —the Western Front settled into a स्थिर battle of attrition with a trench लकीर that changed little until 1917.
On the Eastern सामने, the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians, but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the Germans.
In November the उस्मानी Empire joined the war, opening up fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia and the Sinai.
Italy and Bulgaria went to war in 1915 and Romania in 1916.
In Russia, the tsar 's सरकारी collapsed in March 1917 and a subsequent revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers.
After a 1918 German offensive along the western front, the Allies drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives and American forces began entering the trenches.
Germany, जिससे had its own trouble with revolutionaries, agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918.
The war ended in victory for the Allies.
Events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts, as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a total war.
By the end of the war, four major imperial powers—the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and उस्मानी empires—ceased to exist.
The successor states of the former two lost a great राशि of territory, while the latter two were dismantled entirely.
The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states.
The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict.
The European nationalism spawned by the युद्ध and the breakup of empires, the repercussions of Germany 's defeat and problems with the Treaty of Versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to World युद्ध ii.
The Deepwater Horizon आयल spill ( also referred to as the BP oil spill, the BP oil disaster, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and the Macondo blowout ) was an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico on the BP -operated Macondo Prospect, considered the largest accidental marine आयल spill in the history of the petroleum उद्योग, estimated to be between 8 % and 31 % larger in volume than the earlier Ixtoc i oil spill.
Following the explosion and डूब of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which claimed 11 lives, a sea-floor oil gusher flowed unabated for 87 days, जबतक it was capped on 15 July 2010.
the total discharge is estimated at.
A massive response ensued to protect beaches, wetlands and estuaries from the spreading oil utilizing skimmer ships, floating booms, controlled burns and of Corexit oil dispersant.
After several विफल प्रयत्न to contain the प्रवाह, the well was declared sealed on 19 September 2010.
Some reports indicate the well साईट continues to leak.
Due to the months-long spill, along with प्रतिकूल effects from the response and cleanup activities, extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats, फ़िशिंग and tourism industries, and human health problems have जारी through 2013.Three years after the spill, tar balls could still be found on the Mississippi coast.
Numerous investigations explored the causes of the explosion and record-setting spill.
Notably, the U.S. government 's September 2011 report pointed to defective cement on the well, faulting mostly BP, but also well operator Transocean and contractor Halliburton.
Earlier in 2011, a White House commission likewise blamed BP and its partners for a series of cost-cutting decisions and an insufficient safety system, but also concluded that the spill resulted from `` systemic '' root causes और `` absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies, might खूब recur ''.
In November 2012, BP and the United States Department of Justice settled federal criminal charges with BP pleading guilty to 11 counts of manslaughter, two misdemeanors, and a felony count of lying to Congress.
BP also agreed to four years of government monitoring of its सुरक्षा practices and ethics, और the Environmental Protection Agency announced that BP would be temporarily banned from new अनुबंध with the US government.
BP और the Department of Justice agreed to a record-setting $ 4.525 billion in जुर्माना and other payments but further legal proceedings not expected to conclude until 2014 are जारी to determine payouts and fines under the Clean Water अधिनियम and the Natural Resources Damage Assessment.
As of February 2013, criminal and civil settlements and payments to a trust fund had cost the company $ 42.2 billion.
`` Where the Streets Have No नाम '' is a song by rock band U2.
It is the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree and was released as the album 's third single in August 1987.

Halley 's Comet or Comet Halley ( or ), officially designated 1P/Halley, is the best-known of the short-period comets and is visible from Earth every 75–76 सालो.
Halley is the only short-period comet that is clearly visible to the naked eye from धरती, and thus the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human आजीवन.
Other naked-eye धूमकेतुओं may be brighter and more spectacular, but will appear only once in thousands of सालो.
Halley 's returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers since at तनिक 240 BCE.
Clear records of the comet 's appearances were made by Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European chroniclers, but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time.
The धूमकेतु 's periodicity was पहला संकल्पित in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley, after whom it is now नामित.
Halley 's Comet last appeared in the inner Solar प्रणाली in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061.
During its 1986 apparition, Halley became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft, providing the पहला observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the यांत्रिकी of coma and tail formation.
These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple 's `` dirty snowball '' मॉडल, जिससे correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices – such as water, carbon dioxide and ammonia – and dust.
The missions also provided आंकड़ा जिससे substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas ; for instance it is now understood that Halley 's सतह is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy.

During May, June and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun.
The वही is true of the southern hemisphere in November, दिसम्बर and January.
It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux.
However, due to seasonal lag, June, July और August are the hottest months in the northern गोलार्ध and December, January and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, generally four calendar -based seasons ( with their adjectives ) are recognized : वसन्त ( vernal ), summer ( estival ), autumn ( autumnal ) and winter ( hibernal ).
however, ecologists mostly use a six season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring ( prevernal ) and late summer ( serotinal ) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.
Hot regions have दो or three seasons ; the बरसात ( or wet, or monsoon ) season and the शुष्क season, and in कुछ tropical areas, a कूल or mild season.
in some भाग of the संसार, special `` seasons '' are loosely defined based on important कार्यक्रम such as a hurricane season, tornado season or a wildfire season.

The process of removing the phosphate group is called dephosphorylation.
As the name suggests, alkaline phosphatases are most effective in an alkaline environment.
It is sometimes प्रयुक्त synonymously as basic phosphatase.
triticale ( × Triticosecale ), ( ) is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) और rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories दौरान the late 19th century.
The grain was originally bred in Scotland and Sweden.
Commercially available triticale is almost always a second पीढी संकर, i.e., a क्रॉस between two kinds of primary ( first cross ) triticales.
as a rule, triticale combines the उपज potential and grain quality of गेहूं with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil शर्तें ) of rye.
तभी recently has it महरूम developed into a commercially viable crop.
Depending on the cultivar, triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents.
It is grown mostly for forage or fodder, although some triticale-based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals.
When crossing wheat and rye, wheat is प्रयुक्त as the female parent and rye as the पुरूष parent ( pollen donor ).
The resulting hybrid is sterile, and must be treated साथ colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself.
The primary producers of triticale हैं Poland, Germany, France, Belarus and Australia.
In 2009, according to the खाना and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ), 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 देशों across the world.
The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid, which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different प्रजाति.
In other words, triticale is an allotetraploid.
In earlier years, most work was done on octoploid triticale.
Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time.
The tetraploids showed little promise, but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application.
The CIMMYT triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries.
Triticale has potential in the production of bread और other food products, ऐसे as कुकीज़, pasta, pizza dough and breakfast cereals.
The प्रोटीन content is higher than that of wheat, although the glutenin fraction is less.
The अनाज रै also been stated to have higher levels of lysine than wheat.
Assuming increased acceptance, the milling industry will have to adapt to triticale, as the मिलिंग तकनीकों employed for wheat are unsuited to triticale.
Sell et al. found triticale could be used as a feed grain, and later research मिला its starch was particularly readily पचता.
As a feed अनाज, triticale is already well स्थापित and of high economic importance.
It has received attention as a potential energy crop, and research is फिलहाल होने conducted on the use of the crop 's biomass in bioethanol production.
`` Puff, the Magic Dragon '' is a song written by Leonard Lipton and Peter Yarrow, and made popular by Yarrow 's group पीटर, Paul and मरियम in a 1963 recording.

A college football नेशनल championship in the highest level of collegiate play in the संयुक्त States, currently the नेशनल Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision ( fbs ), is a designation awarded annually by विभिन्न third-party organizations to their चयन ( s ) of the best college football team ( s ).
Division I FBS ( formerly Division I-A ) football is the only NCAA sport in which a वार्षिक चैंपियन is not determined by an NCAA sanctioned चैंपियनशिप event.
Because the championship team is not determined by a NCAA championship or tournament event, it is sometimes unofficially referred to as a `` mythical national championship ``.
Since the NCAA, the sport 's governing body, does not determine or declare a national champion in this field, determination of such has often engendered controversy.
A championship team is independently declared by various individuals and organizations, often referred to as `` selectors ''.
These choices are sometimes at odds with each other.
जबकि the NCAA has never officially endorsed an annual चैंपियनशिप टोली, it has documented the choices of several selectors in the आधिकारिक NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records.
In addition, various third party analysts have independently published their own lists of कया they have determined to be the most legitimate selections for each season.
These हैं also often at odds with each other as खूब as individual school 's claims on national championships, which, for any particular season, may or may not correlate to the selections published elsewhere.
फिलहाल, two widely recognized नेशनल champions selectors are the Associated Press, which conducts a poll of फ़ुटबॉल sportswriters, and the USA Today कोच ' Poll, a poll of American Football Coaches Association active coaches that is contractually obligated to name the winner of the Bowl Championship Series championship खेल as its national champion.
The Milwaukee Brewers are a professional baseball team based in मिल्वौकी, Wisconsin.
The team is a member of the Central प्रभाग of Major League Baseball 's National League and plays its home games at Miller Park.
The team is so named because of the नगर 's association with the brewing industry.
The Washington Nationals are a professional baseball team based in Washington, D.C.
The Nationals are a member of the East Division of the National League of Major League Baseball ( MLB ).
The team 's home ballpark is Nationals Park, located on South Capitol Street in southeast D.C., near the Anacostia River.
The park opened in 2008, replacing RFK स्टेडियम, the team 's home from 2005 to 2007.
The Nationals ' name derives from the former Washington baseball team that had the same name ( used interchangeably with Senators ).
Their nickname is `` the Nats '' —a shortened version that was also used by the old D.C. teams.
An expansion franchise, the club was founded in as the Montreal Expos, the first major league team in कनाडा.
They were based in Montreal, Quebec, and निभाई their home games at Jarry Park Stadium and later in Olympic Stadium.
In, the Expos won a division championship, won their first-ever playoff series by defeating the Philadelphia Phillies, 3–2, and advanced to the National League Championship श्रेणी, where वे would go on to lose to the Los Angeles Dodgers, 3–2, in their only postseason appearance during the strike-shortened season.
the Expos had their highest winning प्रतिशत in the strike-shortened season of, when the team had the best record in baseball.
The team 's subsequent shedding of players caused fan ब्याज to drop off.
After the 2001 season, MLB considered revoking the team 's franchise, along with either the Minnesota Twins or the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
After being purchased by MLB in 2002, the team was moved before the season to Washington and renamed the Nationals, the first relocation since the दूसरी वॉशिंगटन Senators moved to Arlington, Texas, and became the टेक्सास Rangers in.
The Nationals are one of two MLB franchises, and the only one in the National League, that has never played in a World Series ( the Seattle Mariners are the other ).
a contingent fee ( in the United States ) or conditional fee ( in England and Wales ) is any शुल्क for services provided where the fee is payable only if there is a favourable result.
In the law, it is defined as a `` fee charged लिये a lawyer 's services only if the lawsuit is successful or is favorably settled out of court....
Contingent fees हैं usually calculated as a percentage of the client 's net रिकवरी. ''
In the अंग्रेज़ी legal system, it is generally referred to as no win no fee.
A conditional fee agreement between a law firm and a क्लाएंट.
The usual form of this agreement is that the solicitor will take a विधि case on the understanding that if lost, no payment is made.
However, if the case is जीती, the lawyer होगा be हकदार to the normal fee based on hourly billing, plus a कामयाबी fee.
The success fee in England must be as a percentage no वृहद than 100 % of the सामान्य fee.
This contrasts with the contingency fee in the US, which gives the successful attorney a percentage of the damages awarded in favor of his client.
This makes it easier for the poor to pursue their सिविल अधिकारों since otherwise, to sue someone for a tort, one must first be wealthy enough to pursue such litigation in the first place.
However, because of the high रिस्क, few attorneys will take cases on a contingency basis unless they feel the case has good merit.
According to a 2004 book by विधि professor Herbert Kritzer, contingent fees were allowed as of that year in the following countries : Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Dominican Republic, France, Greece, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, the United किंगडम and the United States.
They are also allowed in personal चोट actions in Lithuania.
Recently, they have महरूम allowed in Belgium as खूब.

Sons of Anarchy is a television drama series created by Kurt Sutter about the lives of a close-knit outlaw motorcycle club ऑपरेटिंग in Charming, a fictional town in California 's Central Valley.
the show centers on protagonist Jackson `` Jax '' Teller ( Charlie Hunnam ), the then-vice president of the club, जो begins questioning the club and himself.
Sons of Anarchy premiered on September 3, 2008, on cable network FX.
The third season of the श्रेणी attracted an average of 4.9 million viewers per week, making it FX 's highest rated series ever, surpassing fx 's अन्य hits The Shield, Nip/Tuck, and Rescue Me.
On February 3, 2012, बेटे of Anarchy was renewed for two additional सीज़न, a fifth and a sixth.
Those शामिल in the production of the series imply that a seventh and final season is creator Kurt Sutter 's plan.
The Grímsvötn sub-glacial झीलों ( ; vötn = `` waters '', singular : ) and the volcano of the same name are in south-east Iceland.
They are in the highlands of Iceland at the northwestern side of the Vatnajökull ice-cap.
The lakes are at, at an elevation of.
Beneath the lakes is the मैग्मा chamber of the Grímsvötn volcano.
Grímsvötn is a basaltic volcano which has the highest eruption frequency of all the volcanoes in Iceland and has a southwest-northeast-trending fissure system.
The massive climate-impacting Laki fissure eruption of 1783–1784 थी a part of the same fissure system.
Grímsvötn was erupting at the same time as Laki during 1783, लकिन continued to erupt until 1785.
Because most of the volcano lies underneath vatnajökull, most of its eruptions have been subglacial और the interaction of magma and meltwater from the बर्फ causes phreatomagmatic explosive activity.
on 21 May 2011 at 19:25 UTC, an eruption began, साथ high plumes accompanied by multiple भूकंप, resulting in cancellation of 900 flights in Iceland, and in the United Kingdom, Greenland, जर्मनी, Ireland and Norway on 22–25 may.
Until 25 May the eruption scale had been larger than that of the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull.
The eruption stopped at 02:40 UTC on 25 May 2011, although there was some विस्फोटक activity from the tephra vents affecting तभी the area around the crater.
Vetting is the process of performing a background check on someone before offering them employment, conferring an award, इत्यादि.
A prospective person or project may be vetted before making a hiring decision.
In addition, in intelligence gathering, assets are vetted to determine their usefulness.

A Permanent Resident in Canada is a person who is not a Canadian नागरिक but जो has महरूम granted permission to live and work in कनाडा without any समय limit on his or her stay.
A permanent resident must live in Canada for two years out of every पाँच or risk losing कि status.
A Permanent Resident holds many of the same rights and responsibilities as a Canadian citizen, among others the right to work for any enterprise as well as for the federal or provincial government ( under restriction of access rights to certain regulated professions ).
The main differences are that residents can not :
vote in elections in Canada ;
run for elected दफ्तर ;
hold Canadian passports ;
In addition, they may be allowed to join Canada 's हथियारबंद शक्तियां if the national ब्याज would not be prejudiced.
Permanent residents भी risk deportation for serious crimes committed while resident in Canada.
Permanent residents may apply for Canadian citizenship after तीन years in Canada ; however this is not mandatory.
Erica केन is a fictional character from the American ABC दिन soap opera All my Children.
The character was portrayed by actress Susan lucci from her debut on January 16, 1970 until the last broadcast television episode aired on September 23, 2011.
On February 11, 2013, it was announced that Lucci will guest-star on the Prospect Park 's continuation of All my children.
In the U.S., Erica is considered to be the most popular character in soap opera history.
Regarding the North-American market, TV Guide calls her `` unequivocally the most famous soap ओपेरा character in the history of daytime TV '', and included her in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.
A graph of the US CPI from 1913 to 2006 ( in blue ), and its percent annual change ( in red )
A उपभोक्ता price index ( CPI ) measures changes in the price level of a market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households.
The CPI in the संयुक्त States is defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as `` a measure of the average change over time in the कीमतें paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. ''
The CPI is a statistical अनुमान constructed using the prices of a sample of representative वस्तुएं whose prices हैं collected periodically.
Sub-indexes and sub-sub-indexes are computed for different categories and sub-categories of goods and services, being combined to produce the overall index with weights reflecting their shares in the total of the consumer expenditures covered by the index.
It is one of several price indices calculated by most national statistical agencies.
The annual प्रतिशत change in a CPI is used as a measure of inflation.
A CPI can be used to index ( i.e., समायोजन for the effect of inflation ) the रियल value of wages, salaries, pensions, for regulating prices and for deflating monetary magnitudes to show changes in real values.
In most countries, the CPI is, along साथ the population जनसांख्यिकी and the USA National Income and Product Accounts, one of the most closely watched नेशनल economic statistics.
Knocking on wood, or to टच wood, refers to the apotropaic tradition in western folklore of literally touching/knocking on wood, or merely stating that you are doing or intend same, in अनुक्रम to avoid `` tempting fate `` after making a favourable observation, a boast, or घोषणा concerning one 's अपना मौत.
Rocker भुजा
generally referred to within the context of the आतंरिक combustion engine of automotive, marine, motorcycle and reciprocating aviation इंजन, the rocker भुजा is an oscillating lever that conveys radial movement from the cam lobe into linear movement at the poppet valve to open it.
One end is raised and lowered by a rotating lobe of the camshaft ( either directly or via a tappet ( lifter ) and pushrod ) while the other end acts on the valve स्टेम.
When the camshaft lobe raises the बाहर of the arm, the inside presses down on the valve stem, opening the valve.
When the outside of the arm is permitted to return due to the camshafts rotation, the अंदर rises, allowing the valve वसन्त to बंद the valve.
The drive cam is driven by the camshaft.
This pushes the rocker arm up and down about the trunnion pin or rocker shaft.
Friction may be reduced at the पाइंट of सम्पर्क with the valve stem by a roller cam follower.
a समान arrangement transfers the motion via another roller cam follower to a second rocker arm.
This rotates about the rocker shaft, and transfers the motion via a tappet to the poppet valve.
In this case this opens the intake valve to the cylinder head.
The effective leverage of the arm ( and thus the फ़ोर्स it can exert on the valve stem ) is determined by the rocker arm ratio, the ratio of the distance इससे the rocker arm 's बीच of rotation to the tip divided by the distance from the center of rotation to the point acted on by the camshaft or pushrod.
Current automotive design favors rocker arm ratios of about 1.5:1 to 1.8:1.
however, in the past smaller positive ratios ( the valve lift is greater than the cam lift ) and even negative ratios ( valve lift smaller than the cam lift ) have been used.
Many pre-WW2 इंजन use 1:1 ( neutral ) ratios.
For car engines the rocker arms हैं generally steel stampings, providing a reasonable balance of शक्ति, weight and किफायती cost.
Because the rocker arms are, in part, reciprocating weight, excessive mass especially at the lever ends limits the engine 's ability to पहुँचें high operating speeds.
`` the Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia '' is a Southern Gothic song written by songwriter Bobby Russell and performed in 1972 by his then-wife Vicki लॉरेंस.
Reba McEntire later covered it in 1991.
Recorded in late October 1972 in united/western Studios on Sunset in Hollywood and released less than two weeks later in November 1972, the song centers around the older brother of the narrator, falsely convicted of and executed for a murder, which the narrator herself has committed.
In postal mail, a return address is an explicit inclusion of the address of the व्यक्ति sending the message.
It provides the recipient ( and sometimes authorized intermediaries ) with a means to determine how to respond to the sender of the message if needed.
The return address need not include a प्रेषक 's name, but should include address or P.O. box details in the same रास्ता as the डिलीवरी address चाहिए.
In some countries, the return address is conventionally located in the upper left hand corner of the envelope, card, or label.
In the United Kingdom, the वापसी address is प्रायः placed on the reverse of the envelope, near the top.
व्यवसायों often उपयोग envelopes preprinted साथ a return address.
Many individuals have sheets of adhesive labels preprinted with their home पता to affix to their correspondence.
Charities sometimes include such sheets in mailshots.
Rolls of वापसी Address Labels can be purchased from companies that sell personalized labels to provide individuals an easy way to peel और stick return address labels to their envelopes.
The return address is not required on postal mail.
However, lack of a return address prevents the postal service from being able to return the item if it proves undeliverable ; such as from damage, postage due, or invalid destination.
Such mail may यूँ become dead अक्षर mail.
Should the return address be of a different state or country, the mail may be routed through कि location for ease of return.
A nerve guidance conduit ( भी referred to as an कृत्रिम nerve conduit or artificial nerve graft, as opposed to an autograft ) is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate nerve regeneration and is one of several clinical treatments for nerve injuries.
When direct suturing of the two stumps of a severed nerve can not be accomplished बगैर tension, the standard clinical treatment for peripheral nerve injuries is autologous nerve grafting.
Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve कलम, neural tissue engineering शोध रै focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment, विशेषकर for large defects.
Similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but तंत्रिका regeneration in the central nervous system poses a greater चुनौती because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment.
The creation of artificial conduits is also known as entubulation because the nerve ends and intervening gap हैं enclosed within a tube composed of biological or synthetic materials.
Whether the conduit is in the form of a biologic tube, synthetic tube or tissue-engineered conduit, it should facilitate neurotropic and neurotrophic communication between the proximal and distal ends of the nerve gap, block external inhibitory factors, and provide a physical guidance for axonal regrowth.
the सबसे basic objective of a nerve guidance conduit is to combine physical, chemical, and biological cues under conditions that will foster tissue formation.
Materials that have been used to make biologic tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, जबकि nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide क्रमशः.
Tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many तत्व : scaffold structure, scaffold material, cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors and biomimetic materials.
The choice of which physical, chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment, which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration.
The factors that control material selection include biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical integrity, controllability during nerve growth, implantation and sterilization.
Hardcore Pawn is an American reality television series produced by RDF USA ( later Zodiak यूएसए ) and Richard Dominick Productions for truTV about the day-to-day operations of American Jewelry and Loan, a family-owned pawn shop स्तिथ at 20450 Greenfield सड़क, between 8 Mile Road and the John C. Lodge Freeway in Detroit, Michigan.
The series premiered on August 16, 2010, delivering दो million viewers, setting a record as truTV 's most-watched श्रेणी premiere ever.
Amoxicillin BP
Amoxicillin ( INN ), formerly amoxycillin ( BAN ), and abbreviated amox, is a moderate-spectrum, bacteriolytic, β-lactam antibiotic used to treat बैक्टीरियल infections caused by susceptible microorganisms.
It is usually the drug of choice भीतर the class because it is better absorbed, following oral administration, than other β-lactam antibiotics.
amoxicillin is one of the most common antibiotics prescribed for children.
the drug became available in 1972.
Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by β-lactamase -producing bacteria, which are resistant to a broad spectrum of β-lactam एंटीबायोटिक, such as penicillin.
For this reason, it is often combined with clavulanic acid, a β-lactamase inhibitor.
This increases effectiveness by reducing its susceptibility to β-lactamase resistance.
Lyndon Baines Johnson ( August 27, 1908 – January 22, 1973 ), often referred to as LBJ, was the 36th President of the United States ( 1963–1969 ), a position he assumed after his service as the 37th Vice President of the United राज्य ( 1961–1963 ).
He is one of only four people who served in all four elected federal offices of the United States : Representative, सीनेटर, वाइस President, and President.
Johnson, a Democrat from Texas, served as a United States Representative from 1937–1949 and as a Senator from 1949–1961, including six years as United States Senate Majority Leader, two as Senate Minority Leader and two as Senate Majority Whip.
After campaigning unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1960, Johnson was asked by John F. Kennedy to be his running mate for the 1960 presidential election.
Johnson succeeded to the presidency following the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, completed Kennedy 's term and was elected President in his own right, जीतना by a large margin over Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election.
Johnson was greatly supported by the लोकतांत्रिक Party and as President, he was responsible for designing the `` Great Society `` legislation that included कानून that upheld civil rights, public broadcasting, Medicare, Medicaid, environmental protection, aid to education, and his `` War on गरीबी. ''
Johnson was renowned for his domineering personality and the `` Johnson treatment, '' his coercion of powerful politicians in order to advance legislation.
Meanwhile, Johnson escalated American involvement in the Vietnam War, from 16,000 American advisors/soldiers in 1963 to 550,000 combat troops in early 1968, as American casualties soared and the peace process bogged down.
The involvement stimulated a large angry antiwar movement based especially on university campuses in the U.S. and abroad.
Summer riots broke out in most major शहरों after 1965, and crime rates soared, as his opponents raised demands for `` law and अनुक्रम '' policies.
The Democratic Party split in multiple feuding factions, and after Johnson किया poorly in the 1968 New Hampshire primary, he ended his bid for reelection.
Republican Richard निक्सन was elected to succeed him.
इतिहासकारों argue that जॉनसन 's प्रेसिडेंसी marked the peak of modern liberalism in the United States after the New Deal era.
Johnson is ranked favorably by कुछ historians because of his domestic policies.
The Big Bang Theory cast at Comic Con 2009, from बाएँ : Kunal Nayyar, Simon Helberg, Kaley Cuoco, Jim Parsons, and Johnny Galecki
The अमरीकी sitcom the बिग Bang Theory, created and executive produced by Chuck lorre and Bill Prady, premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007.
The show centers on five characters : roommates Sheldon Cooper and Leonard Hofstadter, two Caltech physicists ; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who जीवनदान across the hall ; and Leonard and Sheldon 's friends and co-workers aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz, and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali.
Over time, several supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles : Leslie Winkle ( season 1 recurring ; season 2 regular ; season 3 अतिथि ), a physicist colleague, and, at different times, a lover of दोनो Leonard and Howard ; Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz ( season 3 recurring ; ऋतु 4-present regular ), a microbiologist, Howard 's fiancée and subsequent wife, and former part-time waitress alongside पैनी ; neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler ( season 3 guest ; season 4 recurring ; season 4-present regular ), who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon on a dating website ; और कॉमिक book store-owner, Stuart Bloom ( seasons 2–5 recurring ; season 6-present regular ), who replaces Howard as Raj 's best friend when Howard is in space.
The show also सुविधाएँ numerous supporting characters, each of whom plays a prominent role in a small group of episodes.
The American Civil War ( ACW ), भी ज्ञात as the War between the States or simply the Civil War ( see naming ), was a civil war लड़ा from 1861 to 1865 between the United States ( the `` संघ '' or the `` North '' ) and several Southern slave states that घोषित their secession and formed the Confederate States of America ( the `` Confederacy '' or the `` South '' ).
The war had its origin in the issue of slavery, especially the extension of slavery into the western territories.
Foreign powers did not intervene.
After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South 's infrastructure, the confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began.
In the 1860 अध्यक्षीय election, Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, opposed expanding slavery into United States ' territories.
Lincoln won, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy.
Outgoing लोकतांत्रिक President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal.
Lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war.
Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession.
Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy.
A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise, and both sides prepared for war.
The Confederates assumed that European countries यहूद so dependent on `` King Cotton `` कि they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.
Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter, a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina.
Lincoln called for each राज्य to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently, four more slave states joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to eleven.
The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy.
The Eastern Theater थी inconclusive in 1861–62.
the autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland ( a Union state ) ended with Confederate retreat at the बैटल of Antietam, dissuading British intervention.
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, जिससे made ending slavery a war लक्ष्य.
To the वेस्ट, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River.
In 1863, Robert E. Lee 's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg.
Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant command of all संघ armies in 1864.
In the Western Theater, William T. Sherman drove east to कैप्चर Atlanta and marched to the sea, destroying Confederate infrastructure साथ the way.
The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the confederacy from all directions, and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond, the Confederate capital.
The defending Confederate army failed, leading to Lee 's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.
The American Civil युद्ध was one of the earliest true industrial wars.
railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively.
The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I.
It remains the deadliest war in American इतिहास, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties.
Historian John huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all उत्तरी males 20–45 years old, और 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40.
Human evolution refers to the evolutionary process leading up to the appearance of modern humans.
While it began साथ the last common पूर्वज of all life, the topic usually covers only the evolutionary history of primates, in particular the genus Homo, and the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of hominids ( or `` great apes '' ).
The study of human evolution involves many scientific disciplines, including physical anthropology, primatology, archaeology, linguistics, evolutionary psychology, embryology and genetics.
According to genetic studies, primates diverged from other mammals about in the लेट Cretaceous period, and the earliest fossils appear in the Paleocene, around.
The family Hominidae diverged इससे the Hylobatidae ( Gibbon ) family 15-20 million years ago, and around, the Ponginae ( orangutans ), diverged from the Hominidae family.
Bipedalism is the basic adaption of the Hominin line, and the earliest bipedal Hominin is considered to be either Sahelanthropus or orrorin, with Ardipithecus, a full bipedal, coming somewhat later.
the gorilla and chimpanzee diverged around the same time, about 4-6 million years ago, and either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin may be our last shared ancestor साथ them.
The early bipedals eventually विकसित into the australopithecines and later the genus Homo.
The earliest documented members of the genus होमो are Homo habilis which evolved around ; the earliest species for which there is positive evidence of use of stone tools.
The brains of these early hominins were परिचय the same size as कि of a chimpanzee.
During the next million years a process of encephalization began, and with the arrival of Homo erectus in the चट्टान record, cranial capacity had doubled to 850 cm3.
Homo erectus and होमो ergaster were the first of the hominina to leave Africa, and these species spread through अफ़्रीकी, Asia, and Europe between.
It is believed that ये species were the first to use fire और complex tools.
According to the Recent African Ancestry theory, modern humans evolved in Africa possibly from Homo heidelbergensis, Homo rhodesiensis or Homo antecessor और migrated out of the continent some 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, replacing local populations of Homo erectus, Homo denisova, Homo floresiensis and Homo neanderthalensis.
Archaic Homo sapiens, the forerunner of anatomically modern humans, evolved between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago.
Recent DNA evidence suggests that several haplotypes of Neanderthal origin हैं present among all non-African populations, and Neanderthals and other hominids, such as denisova hominin may have contributed up to 6 % of उनके genome to present-day इंसानs. < संदर्भ name= '' 10.1126/science.1209202 '' > Anatomically modern इंसानो evolved from archaic Homo sapiens in the Middle paleolithic, about 200,000 years ago.
The transition to behavioral आधुनिकता साथ the development of सांकेतिक culture, language, and specialized lithic प्रौद्योगिकी happened around 50,000 years ago according to many anthropologists although some suggest a gradual change in behavior over a longer time span.

Track and field is a sport comprising various competitive athletic contests based on running, jumping, and throwing.
The name of the sport derives from the प्रतियोगिता venue : a stadium with an oval running track around a ग्रास field.
The throwing and jumping events generally take प्लेस in the central enclosed area.
Track and field falls अंतर्गत the umbrella खेल of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and race walking.
The दो most prestigious international track and field competitions are held अंतर्गत the banner of athletics : the athletics competition at the Olympic Games और the आइएएएफ World Championships in Athletics.
The International Association of Athletics Federations is the international governing देह for track and field.
Track और field events are generally individual sports with athletes challenging प्रत्येक other to decide a single victor.
The racing events are won by the athlete with the fastest time, while the कूद and throwing events are जीती by the athlete who has achieved the greatest distance or height in the contest.
The running events are categorised as sprints, middle and long-distance events, relays, and hurdling.
Regular jumping events include long jump, triple jump, high jump and pole vault, while the most common throwing events are shot put, javelin, discus and hammer.
There हैं also `` combined events '', such as heptathlon and decathlon, in which athletes compete in a क्रमांक of the ऊपर events.
Records are kept of the बेहतरीन performances in विशिष्ट events, at world and national स्तर, right down to a personal level.
However, if athletes हैं deemed to have violated the event 's rules or regulations, they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased.
In North America, the term track and field may be used to refer to athletics in general, rather than specifically track and field events.
The Gulf War ( 2 August 1990 – 28 फ़रवरी 1991 ), codenamed Operation Desert तूफ़ान ( 17 January 1991 – 28 फ़रवरी 1991 ) was a war waged by a U.N.-authorized Coalition फ़ोर्स from 34 nations led by the United States, against Iraq in response to Iraq 's invasion and annexation of Kuwait.
The war is also known under other names, such as the Persian Gulf War, First गल्फ युद्ध, Gulf युद्ध I, or the First Iraq War, before the term `` Iraq War '' became पहचाना instead with the 2003 इराकी War ( also referred to in the U.S. as `` Operation Iraqi स्वतंत्रता '' ).
Kuwait 's invasion by Iraqi troops that began 2 August 1990 was met साथ international condemnation, and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U.N. Security Council.
U.S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged अन्य countries to send their own forces to the scene.
An array of nations joined the Coalition.
The great majority of the Coalition 's military forces were from the u.S., साथ Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading योगदानकर्ता, in that order.
Saudi Arabia paid around US $ 36 billion of the US $ 60 billion cost.
The war was चिह्नित by the beginning of live news on the front lines of the fight, with the primacy of the U.S. network CNN.
The war रै also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily ब्रॉडकास्ट images on board the U.S. बमवर्षक during Operation Desert Storm.
The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial bombardment on 17 January 1991.
This was followed by a ground assault on 24 फ़रवरी.
This was a decisive victory for the Coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory.
The Coalition ceased their advance, and declared a cease-fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started.
Aerial and ground combat was confined to इराकी, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia 's border.
Iraq launched scud missiles against Coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel.
The nickel, in American usage, is a five- cent coin issued by the United States Mint.
Composed of 75 % copper and 25 % nickel, the piece has महरूम struck since 1866.
the silver half dime, equal to five cents, had महरूम जारी since the 1790s.
The American Civil War caused economic hardship, ड्राइविंग gold and silver इससे circulation ; in response, in place of low-value coins, the government at first issued paper currency.
In 1865, Congress abolished the five-cent fractional करेंसी note after Spencer M. Clark, head of the करेंसी Bureau ( today the Bureau of Engraving and Printing ), placed his own portrait on the denomination.
After successful introduction of two-cent and three-cent pieces, without precious metal, Congress also authorized a five-cent piece consisting of base metal ; the Mint began striking this version in 1866.
The initial design of the Shield nickel was struck until 1883, then replaced by the Liberty Head nickel.
The Buffalo nickel was introduced in 1913 as part of a ड्राइव to increase the beauty of American coinage ; in 1938, the Jefferson nickel followed.
In 2004 and 2005, special designs in honor of the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition यहूद issued.
In 2006, the Mint reverted to using Jefferson nickel designer Felix Schlag 's original reverse ( or `` tails '' side ), although a new obverse, by Jamie Franki, थी substituted.
As of 2013, it costs more than eleven cents to produce a nickel ; the Mint is exploring the possibility of reducing लागत by using less expensive धातुओं.
A पोस्टर साथ flowers or clusters of flowers produced by twelve प्रजाति of flowering पौधे from different families
A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants ( पौधे of the प्रभाग Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms ).
The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs.
Flowers may facilitate outcrossing ( fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population ) or allow selfing ( fusion of sperm and अंडा from the same flower ).
Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization ( parthenocarpy ).
Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop.
Flowers give rise to fruit and seeds.
Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the ट्रांसफ़र of pollen.
In addition to facilitating the जनन of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to beautify their environment, and also as objects of romance, अनुष्ठान, धर्म, medicine और as a source of food.
The McDonnell डगलस ( now Boeing ) F-15 Eagle is a twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter designed by McDonnell Douglas to gain and maintain air superiority in aerial combat.

The त्रिभुज first flew in जुलाई 1972, and डाला सेवा in 1976.
Since the 1970s, the Eagle has been exported to Israel, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and अन्य nations.
The F-15 was originally envisioned as a pure air superiority वायुयान.
Its design included a secondary ground-attack काबिलियत that was largely unused.
The design proved flexible enough that an all-weather strike derivative, the F-15E Strike Eagle, was बाद developed, and entered सेवा in 1989.
The F-15 Eagle is expected to be in service with the U.S. Air Force past 2025.

Christopher Columbus ( इतालवी : Cristoforo कोलोन ; Spanish : Cristóbal Colón ; Portuguese : Cristóvão कोलोन ; before 31 October 145120 May 1506 ) थी an Italian explorer, navigator, and colonizer, born in the Republic of Genoa, in what is today northwestern Italy.
अंतर्गत the auspices of the Catholic monarchs of Spain, he completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean that led to general यूरोपीय जागरूकता of the American continents.
Those voyages, and his efforts to establish permanent settlements on the island of Hispaniola, initiated the Spanish colonization of the New World.
In the कॉन्टेक्स्ट of emerging western imperialism and economic competition between European kingdoms seeking wealth through the establishment of trade routes and colonies, कोलंबस 's speculative proposal, to पहुँचें the East Indies by sailing westward, eventually received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in it a promise, however remote, of gaining the upper hand over rival powers in the contest लिये the lucrative मसाला trade with Asia.
During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching जापानी as he had intended, Columbus landed in the Bahamas द्वीपसमूह, at a locale he named San Salvador.
Over the course of three अधिक voyages, Columbus visited the Greater and lesser Antilles, as well as the Caribbean coast of Venezuela and Central America, claiming उन्हें for the Spanish Empire.
Though Columbus थी नहीं the first European explorer to reach the Americas ( having महरूम preceded by the Norse expedition led by leif Ericson in the 11th century ), Columbus 's voyages led to the first lasting European contact with the Americas, inaugurating a period of European exploration, conquest, and colonization that lasted for several centuries.
They had, therefore, an enormous impact in the ऐतिहासिक development of the modern Western संसार.
Columbus खुद saw his accomplishments primarily in the light of the spreading of the Christian religion.
Never admitting that he had reached a continent previously unknown to Europeans, rather than the ईस्ट Indies he had set out लिये, Columbus called the inhabitants of the lands he visited indios ( स्पेनी for `` Indians `` ).
Columbus 's strained relationship with the Spanish crown and its appointed colonial administrators in America led to his arrest and dismissal as governor of the settlements on the island of Hispaniola in 1500, and बाद to protracted litigation over the benefits जिससे कोलंबस and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown.
Bred in Germany, the Boxer is a breed of stocky, medium-sized, short-haired dogs.
The coat is smooth and tight-fitting ; colors are fawn or brindled, with or without श्वेत markings, which may cover the entire body.
Boxers are brachycephalic ( they have broad, short skulls ), and have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism ( an underbite ), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey.
the Boxer was bred इससे the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct bullenbeisser, and is part of the Molosser group.
Boxers were first exhibited in a dog show for St. Bernards in Munich in 1895, the first Boxer club being founded the next year.
Based on 2012 American Kennel Club आंकडे, Boxers held steady as the seventh most popular breed of dog in the United States for the third consecutive year.
Serial ata ( SATA ) is a कंप्यूटर bus इंटरफ़ेस कि connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard डिस्क drives and optical drives.
सीरियल ATA replaces the older AT Attachment standard ( ATA ; later referred to as Parallel ATA or PATA ), offering several advantages over the older interface : reduced cable size और cost ( seven conductors instead of 40 ), native hot swapping, faster data transfer through higher signalling दरों, and more efficient transfer through an ( optional ) I/O queuing protocol.
SATA host adapters and devices communicate via a high-speed serial cable over two pairs of conductors.
In contrast, parallel ATA ( the redesignation for the विरासत ATA specifications ) used a 16-bit wide data bus with many additional support and control signals, all operating at much lower frequency.
To ensure backward compatibility with legacy ATA software and applications, SATA uses the वही मौलिक ATA and ATAPI command-set as legacy ATA devices.
SATA has replaced parallel ATA in consumer desktop and laptop computers, and रै largely replaced PATA in new embedded applications.
SATA 's market share in the desktop PC market was 99 % in 2008.
pata remains widely used in industrial और embedded applications that use CompactFlash storage, even though the new CFast standard is based on SATA.
Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from The Serial ATA International Organization ( उर्फ.
SATA-IO, serialata.org ).
The SATA-IO group collaboratively creates, reviews, ratifies, and publishes the interoperability specifications, the test cases, and plug-fests.
As with many other उद्योग compatibility मानकों, the SATA content ownership is transferred to other industry bodies : primarily the INCITS T13 उपसमिति ATA, the incits T10 subcommittee ( SCSI ) ; a subgroup of T10 responsible for Serial Attached SCSI ( SAS ).
The complete specification from SATA-IO.
The remainder of this article will try to use the terminology and specifications of SATA-IO.
The history of the Internet began with the development of electronic कंप्यूटर in the 1950s.
The public was first introduced to the concepts that होता सीसे to the Internet when a message was भेजा over the ARPANet from computer science Professor लियोनार्ड Kleinrock 's laboratory at University of California, Los Angeles ( UCLA ), after the second piece of network उपकरण was installed at Stanford Research Institute ( SRI ).
पैकेट switched networks such as ARPANET, Mark I at NPL in the UK, CYCLADES, Merit Network, Tymnet, and Telenet, were developed in the लेट 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols.
The ARPANET in particular led to the विकास of protocols for internetworking, in which multiple separate networks could be joined साथ into a network of networks.
In 1982, the Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) was standardized, and consequently, the concept of a world-wide network of interconnected TCP/IP networks, called the Internet, was introduced.
Access to the ARPANET थी expanded in 1981 when the नेशनल Science Foundation ( NSF ) विकसित the Computer Science Network ( CSNET ) and again in 1986 when NSFNET provided access to supercomputer sites in the United States from research and education organizations.
Commercial Internet service providers ( ISPs ) began to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
the ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990.
the Internet was commercialized in 1995 when NSFNET थी decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic.
Since the mid-1990s, the Internet has था a revolutionary प्रभाव on culture and commerce, including the rise of near-instant communication by electronic mail, instant messaging, Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) `` phone काल्स '', two-way interactive video calls, and the World चौड़ी Web with its discussion forums, blogs, social networking, and online shopping sites.
The research and education community continues to develop और use उन्नत networks such as NSF 's बहुत high speed Backbone संजाल Service ( vBNS ), Internet2, and National LambdaRail.
Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s, 10-Gbit/s, or more.
The Internet 's takeover over the global संचार landscape was लगभग instant in historical terms : it only communicated 1 % of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 1993, already 51 % by 2000, and more than 97 % of the telecommunicated information by 2007.
Today the Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information, commerce, entertainment, and social networking.

RAID ( redundant array of independent disks, originally redundant array of inexpensive disks ) is a storage technology that combines multiple disk drive components into a logical unit.
Data is distributed across the drives in one of several ways called `` RAID levels '', depending on the level of redundancy and performance required.
The term `` RAID '' थी first defined by David Patterson, Garth A. Gibson, and रैंडी katz at the University of California, Berkeley in 1987.
Marketers representing industry RAID manufacturers later attempted to reinvent the term to describe a redundant array of independent disks as a means of disassociating a low-cost expectation from RAID technology.
रेड is now used as an umbrella term for computer data storage schemes that can divide and replicate data among multiple physical drives : RAID is an example of storage virtualization and the array can be accessed by the operating system as one single drive.
The different योजनाएं or architectures हैं named by the शब्द RAID followed by a क्रमांक ( e.g. RAID 0, RAID 1 ).
प्रत्येक scheme provides a different संतुलन between the key goals : reliability and उपलब्धता, performance और capacity.
RAID levels greater than RAID 0 provide protection against unrecoverable ( sector ) read errors, as well as whole disk failure.

Whether appointed by the legislature, the executive, or an organization ( or, less frequently, elected by the constituency that he or she serves ), the typical duties of an ombudsman are to investigate complaints and attempt to resolve them, usually through recommendations ( बाइंडिंग or not ) or mediation.
Ombudsmen sometimes also aim to identify systemic issues leading to poor service or breaches of people 's rights.
At the national स्तर, most ombudsmen have a wide mandate to सौदे with the entire public sector, and sometimes also elements of the private sector ( for example, contracted सेवा प्रदाताओं ).
In some cases, there is a more restricted mandate, for example with particular sectors of society.

New England is a region in the northeastern corner of the United States consisting of the six states of Maine, New हैम्पशायर, Vermont, Massachusetts, rhode Island, and Connecticut.
New England is bordered by New York state to the southwest, Quebec to the northwest, and New ब्रंसविक and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.
In one of the earliest English settlements in North America, Pilgrims from England first settled in New England in 1620, to form Plymouth Colony.
Ten years later, the Puritans settled north of Plymouth उपनिवेश in Boston, thus forming Massachusetts Bay Colony.
Over the next 130 years, New England fought in four French and Indian Wars, until the British defeated the French and उनके native allies in North America.
In the late 18th सदी, the New इंग्लैण्ड Colonies initiated the resistance to the British Parliament 's efforts to impose नई कर without the consent of the colonists.
The Boston Tea Party was a protest to which Great Britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping Massachusetts of self-government, which were termed the `` Intolerable अधिनियमों `` by the colonists.
The confrontation led to open warfare in 1775, the expulsion of the British authorities इससे नई England in spring 1776, और the Declaration of Independence in July 1776.
Some of the first movements of अमरीकी साहित्य, philosophy, and education originated in New England.
The region played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery, and was the first region of the United States to be transformed by the औद्योगिक Revolution.
Today, New इंग्लैण्ड is a major world center of शिक्षा, high technology, insurance, and medicine.
Boston is its cultural, financial, educational, medical and transportation बीच.
Each राज्य is principally subdivided into small incorporated municipalities known as नई England towns, जिससे हैं often governed by town meeting.
The तभी unincorporated territory in New England exists in the sparse, northern regions of वर्मांट, New Hampshire, and Maine.
Since 1970, voters have more often supported उदार candidates at the state and federal level than those of any other region in the United States.
नई England is the only एक of the United राज्य Census Bureau 's nine regional विभाजन जिनकी name does not derive from its भूगोल, and it is the only multi-state region with clear, consistent boundaries.
It maintains a strong sense of cultural identity set apart from the rest of the country, although the terms of this identity हैं often contested, combining Puritanism with liberalism, agrarian life with industry, and isolation with immigration.

The Eastern समय Zone ( ET ) encompasses 17 U.S. states in the eastern part of the contiguous United States, parts of Canada and three countries in दक्षिण अमेरिका.
Places that use Eastern Standard Time ( EST ) when observing standard time ( autumn/winter ) are 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time ( ).
पूर्वी Daylight Time ( EDT ), when observing daylight saving time ( spring/summer ) is 4 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time ( ).
In the northern parts of the समय zone, during the second Sunday in March, at 2:00 a.m. est, clocks हैं उन्नत to 3:00 a.m. EDT leaving a one hour `` gap. ''
During the first Sunday in November, at 2:00 a.m. EDT, clocks are स्थानांतरित back to 1:00 a.m. EST, thus `` duplicating '' one hour.

मानक form of the periodic table.
The colors represent अलग श्रेणी of elements explained below.
The periodic तालिका is a tabular display of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic numbers, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties.
Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number ( number of protons ).
The मानक form of table comprises an 18 × 7 grid or main body of elements, positioned above a smaller double row of elements.
the table can also be deconstructed into four rectangular blocks : the s-block to the left, the p-block to the right, the d-block in the मध्य, and the f-block नीचे that.
The rows of the table are called periods ; the columns of the s-, d-, and p-blocks are called groups, with some of these having names such as the halogens or the noble gases.
Since, by definition, a periodic table incorporates पुनरावर्ती रुझान, any ऐसे table can be प्रयुक्त to derive relationships between the गुण of the elements and predict the properties of new, yet to be discovered or synthesized, elements.
As a परिणाम, a periodic table—whether in the standard form or some other variant—provides a useful फ्रेमवर्क for analyzing chemical behavior, and such tables are widely used in chemistry and other sciences.
Although precursors exist, Dmitri Mendeleev is generally credited with the publication, in 1869, of the first widely recognized आवधिक table.
He developed his table to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then-known elements.
Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that would be expected to भरण gaps in this table.
Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in सवाल were subsequently discovered.
Mendeleev 's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new तत्व and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behavior.
सब तत्व इससे atomic numbers 1 ( hydrogen ) to 118 ( ununoctium ) have been discovered or synthesized.
The elements from 1 to 98 ( californium ) have been found to exist naturally, हालांकि some are found only in trace amounts and were initially discovered by synthesis in laboratories.
The elements after 98 have only been synthesized in laboratories.
Production of elements beyond ununoctium is being pursued, with the question of how the periodic table may need to be modified to accommodate any such additions being a matter of ongoing debate.
Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories.

Joseph काहिल 's New South Wales Government gave the go-ahead for work to begin in 1958.
The government 's bold decision to select Utzon 's design is often overshadowed by the scandal that followed.
It is on Bennelong पाइंट in Sydney Harbour, close to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It sits at the northeastern टिप of the Sydney सेंट्रल कारोबार district ( the सीबीडी ), surrounded on three sides by the harbour ( Sydney Cove and Farm कोव ) and inland by the Royal Botanic Gardens.
Contrary to its name, it houses अनेक performance venues.
It is among the busiest performing कला centres in the world, hosting over 1,500 प्रदर्शन each year attended by some 1.2 million लोगों.

A graph of body mass index as a function of body mass and body height is shown ऊपर.
The dashed lines represent subdivisions within a major class.
For instance the `` Underweight '' वर्गीकरण is further divided into `` severe '', `` moderate '', and `` mild '' subclasses.
The body mass index ( BMI ), or Quetelet index, is a measure for इंसान देह shape based on an individual 's weight और height.
It was devised between 1830 और 1850 by the Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet during the course of developing `` social physics ''.
देह द्रव्यमान index is defined as the individual 's body mass divided by the square of their height.
The formulae universally used in medicine produce a unit of measure of kg/m2.
BMI can also be संकल्पित using a बीएमआई chart, which displays BMI as a function of weight ( horizontal axis ) and height ( लंबवत axis ) using contour lines for different मान of BMI or colors for different BMI categories.

Thomas Paine ( January 29, 1737 ( NS February 9, 1737 ) – June 8, 1809 ) was an english-american political activist, author, political theorist and revolutionary.
As the author of two highly influential pamphlets at the start of the अमरीकी Revolution, he inspired the देशप्रेमी in 1776 to declare independence from Britain.
His ideas reflected Enlightenment era rhetoric of transnational human rights.
He has been called `` a corsetmaker by trade, a journalist by profession, and a propagandist by inclination. ''
Born in Thetford, इंग्लैण्ड, in the काउंटी of Norfolk, Paine emigrated to the British American colonies in 1774 with the सहायता of Benjamin Franklin और he arrived in time to participate in the American Revolution.
His principal contributions were the powerful, widely read pamphlet Common Sense ( 1776 ), the all-time best-selling American book कि advocated colonial America 's independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and The American Crisis ( 1776–83 ), a pro-revolutionary pamphlet series.
आम Sense was so influential that John Adams said, `` Without the pen of the author of Common Sense, the तलवार of Washington would have been raised in vain.”
Paine lived in France for सबसे of the 1790s, becoming deeply involved in the French Revolution.
He wrote the Rights of Man ( 1791 ), in part a defence of the French Revolution against its critics.
His attacks on British writer Edmund Burke led to a trial and conviction in absentia in 1792 for the crime of seditious libel.
In 1792, despite not being able to speak French, he was निर्वाचित to the French नेशनल Convention.
The Girondists regarded him as an ally.
Consequently, the Montagnards, especially Robespierre, regarded him as an enemy.

He became बदनाम because of the Age of Reason ( 1793–94 ), his book that advocates deism, promotes reason और freethinking, and argues against institutionalized धर्म in general and Christian doctrine in particular.
He also wrote the pamphlet Agrarian Justice ( 1795 ), discussing the origins of property, and introduced the concept of a गारंटी minimum income.
In 1802, he returned to America where he died on June 8, 1809.
Only छह people attended his funeral as he had been ostracized लिये his ridicule of Christianity.
Clinical trials are sets of tests in medical research and drug development that generate सुरक्षा and efficacy data ( or more specifically, सूचना about adverse drug reactions and adverse effects of other treatments ) for health interventions ( e.g., drugs, diagnostics, डिवाइस, therapy protocols ).
वे are conducted only after satisfactory information has been gathered on the quality of the non clinical safety, and health authority/ethics कमेटी approval is granted in the country where approval of the ड्रग or device is sought.
Previously, many emerging countries did not require local trials for product approvals.
Now, though emerging countries still accept data from U.S./Europe, they also require some local ट्रायल.
Depending on the type of product and the stage of its development, जांचकर्ताओं initially enroll volunteers and/or patients into small pilot studies, and subsequently conduct larger scale studies in patients that प्रायः compare the new product with others already approved for the affliction of interest.
As धनात्मक सुरक्षा and efficacy data are gathered, the number of patients is typically increased.
Clinical trials can vary in size, and can involve a सिंगल research एंटिटी in one country or many such entities in multiple countries.
A पूरा series of trials may incur sizable costs, and the burden of paying for all the necessary people और services is usually borne by the प्रायोजक, जिससे may be a governmental organization or a pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical यंत्र company.
When the diversity of required support roles exceeds the resources of the प्रायोजक, a clinical trial is managed by an outsourced संगी, such as a contract research organization or a clinical trials unit in the academic sector.
The ग्रीन Bay पैकर्स are an American football team based in Green Bay, विस्कॉन्सिन.
वे are members of the North Division of the National Football Conference ( NFC ) in the National Football League ( एनएफएल ).
Green Bay is the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, having been organized and playing in 1919.
The Packers are the only non-profit, community-owned major league पेशेवर sports team in the United States.
The Packers are the last vestige of `` छोटी कस्बा teams '' कि were once common in the NFL during the 1920s और 1930s.
संस्थापित in 1919 by Earl `` Curly '' Lambeau ( hence the name Lambeau Field on which the team plays ) and George Whitney Calhoun, the Green Bay Packers can trace their lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green खाड़ी dating back to 1896.
In 1919 और 1920 the Packers competed as a semi-professional football team against क्लब इससे around Wisconsin and the Midwest.
They joined the American पेशेवर Football Association ( APFA ) in 1921, the forerunner to what is known today as the National Football League ( NFL ).
Although Green Bay is the last NFL `` small town '' team, its local fan base and media extends into nearby Milwaukee ; the team also played selected home games there between 1933 and 1994.
The Green Bay Packers have won 13 league championships ( अधिक than any अन्य team in the NFL ), including nine NFL championships prior to the Super Bowl era and four Super कटोरी victories —in 1967 ( Super Bowl I ), 1968 ( Super Bowl II ), 1997 ( Super कटोरी XXXI ) and 2011 ( Super Bowl XLV ).

Ethanol fuel is ethanol ( ethyl alcohol ), the same type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages.
It is most often used as a motor fuel, mainly as a biofuel additive for gasoline.
World ethanol production for transport fuel tripled between 2000 and 2007 इससे 17 billion to more than 52 billion liters.
From 2007 to 2008, the share of ethanol in वैश्विक gasoline type fuel use increased from 3.7 % to 5.4 %.
In 2011 worldwide ethanol ईंधन production reached 22.36 billion U.S. liquid gallons ( bg ) ( 84.6 billion liters ), with the United States as the top निर्माता with 13.9 bg ( 52.6 billion liters ), accounting for 62.2 % of वैश्विक production, followed by Brazil साथ 5.6 bg ( 21.1 अरब liters ).
Ethanol fuel रै a `` गैसोलीन गैलन equivalency `` ( GGE ) value of, which means 1.5 gallons of ethanol produce the energy of one gallon of gasoline.
Ethanol fuel is widely used in ब्राज़ील and in the United States, and together both countries were responsible लिये 87.1 % of the संसार 's इथेनॉल fuel production in 2011.
Most cars on the road today in the u.S. can चलाएं on blends of up to 10 % ethanol, and ethanol represented 10 % of the U.S. गैसोलीन fuel supply derived from domestic sources in 2011.
Since 1976 the Brazilian government रै made it mandatory to blend ethanol साथ gasoline, and चूंकि 2007 the legal blend is around 25 % ethanol and 75 % gasoline ( E25 ).
By December 2011 Brazil had a बेड़े of 14.8 million flex-fuel automobiles and light trucks and 1.5 million flex-fuel motorcycles that regularly use neat ethanol fuel ( known as E100 ).
Bioethanol is a form of बेदर्दी energy that can be produced from agricultural feedstocks.
It can be बना इससे very common crops such as sugar cane, potato, manioc and corn.
वहीँ has been considerable debate about how useful bioethanol will be in replacing gasoline.
चिंताएं about its production and use relate to increased food prices due to the large amount of arable land required for crops, as well as the उर्जा and pollution balance of the whole cycle of ethanol production, especially from corn.
Recent developments with cellulosic ethanol production and commercialization may allay some of these concerns.
Cellulosic ethanol offers promise because cellulose fibers, a major and universal घटक in plant cells walls, can be used to produce ethanol.
According to the International Energy Agency, cellulosic इथेनॉल could allow ethanol fuels to play a much bigger role in the future than previously thought.

A plaque commemorating the location of the Sarajevo assassination ( image taken in 2009 )
On 28 June 1914, Archduke फ्रांज Ferdinand of ऑस्ट्रिया, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian सिंहासन, and his wife, सोफी, Duchess of hohenberg, were shot dead in Sarajevo, by Gavrilo Princip, one of a group of six Bosnian Serb assassins coordinated by Danilo Ilić.
The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary 's south-Slav provinces so they could be combined into a वृहद Serbia or a Yugoslavia.
The assassins ' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young बोस्निया.
Serbian सैन्य officers stood behind the attack.
At the top of these Serbian military conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević, his righthand man प्रमुख Vojislav Tankosić, and Masterspy Rade Malobabić.
Major Tankosić armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them.
The assassins were given access to the same clandestine tunnel of safe-houses and agents that Rade Malobabić used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into austria-hungary.
The assassins, the key सदस्यों of the clandestine tunnel, and the कुंजी Serbian military षड्यंत्रकारियों who were still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished.
Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914.
The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian kangaroo court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges ; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators.
Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two ट्रायल and related records.
Assignment of responsibility for the bombing and murders of 28 June is highly controversial because the attack led to the outbreak of World War I one month later.

The New Covenant ( Hebrew • • — Greek • • diatheke kaine ) is a biblical interpretation originally derived from a phrase in the Book of Jeremiah, in the Hebrew Scriptures.
it is often thought of as an eschatological Messianic Age or world to आइये and is सम्बन्धित to the biblical concept of the Kingdom of God.
Generally, Christians believe that the नई Covenant was instituted at the Last भोजन as part of the Eucharist, which in the Gospel of John शामिल the New Commandment.
There हैं several Christian eschatologies that further define the New Covenant, as an example an inaugurated eschatology defines and describes the New Covenant as an ongoing relationship between Christian believers and God that will be in full fruition after the Second Coming of Christ ; that is, it will not only be in full fruition in believing hearts, but in the future external world as well.
The connection between the रक्त of Christ and the New Covenant is seen in most modern English translations of the New Testament with the saying : `` this cup that is poured out for you is the new वचन in my blood ''.
Christians believe कि Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant, and that the Blood of मसीह shed at his crucifixion is the required blood of the covenant.
As साथ all covenants between God and man described in the बाइबल, the New Covenant is considered `` a bond in blood sovereignly administered by God. ''
It has been theorized that the New Covenant is the Law of Christ as spoken दौरान his Sermon on the Mount.
The following List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States documents the सबसे prominent cases of each presidency.
As granted by the Constitution ( Article II, Section 2, clause 1 ), Presidents have the power to grant clemency in one or more of the following ways : the ability to grant a full pardon, to commute a sentence, or to rescind a fine.
U.S. Presidents have no power to grant clemency for crimes prosecuted under state law.
as to the difference between a pardon and a commutation:
A pardon is an executive order vacating a conviction.
A commutation is the mitigation of the sentence of someone currently serving a sentence for a crime pursuant to a conviction, without vacating the conviction itself.
Approximately 20,000 pardons and clemencies were issued by u.S. presidents in the 20th century अलोन.
The records of acts of दया were public until 1934.
In 1981 the Office of the Pardon Attorney was निर्मित और records from President H. W. Bush forward are now सूचीबद्ध.

Overview of the calvin cycle and carbon fixation
The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis are chemical reactions कि convert carbon dioxide and other यौगिकों into glucose.
These reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside of the thylakoid membranes.
These प्रतिक्रियाएँ take the light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them.
There are three phases to the light-independent reactions, collectively called the Calvin cycle : carbon fixation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate ( RuBP ) regeneration.
Despite its name, this process occurs only when light is available.
Plants do not carry out the Calvin cycle by night.
They, instead, release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves.
This process happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis ( C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation, and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism ) ; CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day in order to make this process work.

Between 1936 and 1950, National City Lines and प्रशांत नगर Lines —with investment from GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack Trucks, and the Federal Engineering Corporation—bought over 100 electric surface-traction systems in 45 cities including Baltimore, Newark, Los Angeles, New York City, Oakland and San Diego and converted them into bus operation.
Several of the companies involved were convicted in 1949 of षड्यंत्र to monopolize interstate commerce but were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the ownership of ये companies.
Some suggest that this कार्यक्रम निभाई a key role in the decline of public transit in cities आरपार the United States ; notably Edwin J.

One writer on the subject has suggested that Snell and others fell into simplistic षड्यंत्र theory thinking, bordering on paranoid delusions saying `` Clearly, GM waged a war on electric traction.
It was indeed an all out assault, but by no means the single reason for the विफलता of rapid पारगमन.
Also, it is just as clear that actions and inactions by government contributed significantly to the विलोपन of electric traction. ''
Only a small handful of U.S. cities have surviving effective rail-based urban transport systems based on streetcars or trams, including Newark, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Boston ; others are re-introducing them.

Grasslands are areas where the वनस्पति is dominated by grasses ( Poaceae ), however sedge ( Cyperaceae ) और rush ( Juncaceae ) परिवारों can also be found.
grasslands occur naturally on सब continents except अंटार्कटिक.
In शीतोष्ण latitudes, such as northwestern Europe and the Great Plains and California in North America, native grasslands are dominated by perennial bunch ग्रास species, whereas in warmer climates annual प्रजाति form a greater component of the vegetation.
Grasslands are found in most ecoregions of the Earth.
For example there are five terrestrial ecoregion classifications ( subdivisions ) of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome ( ' ecosystem ' ), जिससे is one of eight terrestrial ecozones of the Earth 's surface.
Henna ( Lawsonia inermis, also called henna tree ) or Hina is a flowering संयंत्र, the sole species in the genus Lawsonia in the family Lythraceae.
the English name `` henna '' comes from the Arabic ( ALA-LC : ḥinnāʾ / pronounced ) or colloquially, loosely pronounced.
The name is also प्रयुक्त for dye preparations derived from the plant, and for the art of temporary tattooing आधारित on those dyes.
Henna has been used चूंकि antiquity to dye skin, hair, and fingernails, as well as fabrics including Silk, wool and leather.
Additionally, the नाम is misused for other skin and hair dyes, such as black henna or neutral henna, which हैं not derived from the plant.
A thin film is a layer of सामग्री ranging from fractions of a nanometer ( monolayer ) to several micrometers in thickness.
Electronic semiconductor devices and optical coatings are the main applications benefiting from thin-film निर्माण.
A familiar अनुप्रयोग of thin films is the household mirror, which typically has a thin metal coating on the वापस of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface.
The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors.
A very-thin-film coating ( less than a nanometer thick ) is used to produce two-way mirrors.
The performance of optical coatings ( e.g. antireflective, or AR, coatings ) हैं typically enhanced when the thin-film कोटिंग consists of multiple layers having varying thicknesses and refractive indices.
Similarly, a आवधिक structure of alternating thin films of different materials may collectively form a so-called superlattice which exploits the phenomenon of quantum confinement by restricting electronic phenomena to two-dimensions.
Work is being done with ferromagnetic and ferroelectric thin films for उपयोग as computer memory.
It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals, via thin-film drug delivery.
Thin-films are used to produce thin-film batteries.
Thin films are also प्रयुक्त in dye-sensitized solar कोशिकाएं.
Ceramic thin films are in wide use.
The relatively high hardness and inertness of ceramic materials make this type of thin कोटिंग of interest for सुरक्षा of substrate materials against corrosion, oxidation and wear.
In particular, the use of such coatings on cutting tools can extend the life of these items by several orders of magnitude.
Research is being done on a new class of thin-film inorganic oxide materials, called amorphous heavy-metal cation multicomponent oxides, which could be used to make transparent transistors that are inexpensive, stable, and environmentally benign.

The driver and passenger front airbags, after having been deployed, in a British Peugeot 306 car.
An airbag is a vehicle safety device.
It is an occupant restraint system consisting of a flexible fabric envelope or cushion designed to inflate rapidly during an automobile collision.
Its purpose is to cushion occupants during a crash and provide protection to उनके bodies when they strike interior objects such as the steering wheel or a खिड़की.
Modern vehicles may contain multiple airbag modules in various side और frontal locations of the passenger seating positions, and सेंसर may deploy one or more airbags in an प्रभाव zone at variable rates based on the type, angle and severity of impact ; the airbag is designed to only inflate in moderate to कठोर frontal crashes.
Airbags are सामान्यतः designed with the intention of supplementing the protection of an occupant who is correctly restrained with a seatbelt.
Most designs are inflated through pyrotechnic means and can only be operated once.
Newer side-impact airbag modules consist of संपीडित air cylinders that are triggered in the event of a side impact vehicle impact.
The first commercial designs were introduced in passenger automobiles during the 1970s with limited success.
Broad commercial adoption of airbags occurred in अनेक markets during the late 1980s and early 1990s with a driver airbag, and a front यात्री airbag as well on some cars ; and many modern vehicles now include four or more units.

China रै been the source of many inventions, including the Four Great आविष्कारों : papermaking, the compass, gunpowder, and printing ( both woodblock and movable type ).
The list below contains these and other inventions.
The Chinese invented technologies involving mechanics, hydraulics, and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, अभियान्त्रिकी, music theory, craftsmanship, nautics, and warfare.
By the Warring States Period ( 403–221 BC ), they had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, while the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han Dynasty ( 202 BC – AD 220 ).
A sophisticated economic system in China gave जनम to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty ( 960–1279 ).
The invention of gunpowder by the 10th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, हाथ cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket, and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads.
With the navigational aid of the 11th-century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st-century sternpost अरित्र, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa and Egypt.
In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had प्रयुक्त the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century.
They भी made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.
The contemporaneous Peiligang and Pengtoushan cultures represent the oldest Neolithic cultures of China और were formed around 7000 BC.
Some of the first आविष्कारों of पाषाणकालीन, प्रागैतिहासिक China include semilunar and rectangular stone knives, stone hoes and हुकुम, the cultivation of millet, rice and the soybean, the refinement of sericulture, the building of rammed earth structures with lime -plastered house floors, the creation of the potter 's wheel, the creation of pottery with cord-mat-basket designs, the सृष्टि of pottery tripods and pottery steamers, और the development of ceremonial vessels and scapulimancy for उद्देश्य of divination.
फ्रांसिस्का Bray argues कि the domestication of the ox and buffalo during the Longshan culture ( c. 3000–c. 2000 BC ) period, the absence of Longshan-era irrigation or high-yield crops, full evidence of Longshan cultivation of dry-land खाद्यान्न crops जिससे gave high yields `` only when the soil was carefully cultivated, '' suggest that the plow was known at least by the Longshan culture period and explains the high agricultural production yields which allowed the rise of Chinese civilization during the Shang Dynasty ( c. 1600–c. 1050 bc ).
With later inventions such as the multiple-tube seed drill and heavy moldboard iron plow, China 's agricultural output could sustain a much larger population.
For the purposes of this list, inventions are regarded as technological firsts developed in China, and as such does not include foreign technologies जिससे the Chinese acquired through सम्पर्क, such as the windmill from the Middle East or the telescope from Early modern Europe.
It also does not include technologies developed elsewhere and later invented separately by the Chinese, such as the odometer and chain pump.
Scientific, mathematic or natural discoveries, changes in minor अवधारणाओं of design or style and artistic innovations can not be regarded as inventions and do not appear on the list.

Globalization ( or globalisation—see spelling differences ) is the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, products, ideas, and other पहलुओं of संस्कृति.
Put in simple terms, globalization refers to processes that promote world-wide exchanges of नेशनल and cultural resources.
अग्रिम in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, including the rise of the Internet, are major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities.
Though several scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times, others trace its history long पहले the यूरोपीय age of discovery and voyages to the New World.
Some even trace the origins to the third मिलेनियम BCE.
Since the शुरूआत of the 20th century, the pace of globalization रै intensified at a rapid rate, especially during the Post Cold War era.
The term globalization has महरूम in increasing उपयोग since the mid-1980s and especially since the mid-1990s.
In 2000, the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) पहचाना four basic aspects of globalization : trade and transactions, capital और investment आंदोलनों, migration and गति of people and the dissemination of knowledge.
Further, पर्यावरणीय challenges such as climate change, cross-boundary water and air pollution, और over-fishing of the ocean are linked with globalization.
globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization, economics, socio-cultural resources, और the natural environment.

World War I ( WWI ) was a global war केंद्रित in Europe कि began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918.
It was predominantly called the World War or the Great War from its occurrence until the start of World War II in 1939, and the First World युद्ध or World War I thereafter.
it शामिल all the world 's great powers, which were assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the United किंगडम, France and Russia ) and the Central Powers ( originally the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy ; but, as austria–hungary था taken the अप्रिय against the agreement, Italy did not enter into the war ).
These alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy, Japan and the United States joined the Allies, and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers.
Ultimately, more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in इतिहास.
More than 9 million combatants were killed, largely क्युकी of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility.
It was the fifth- deadliest conflict in संसार history, subsequently paving the way for various political changes, such as revolutions in many of the nations involved.
One of the long-term causes of the war was the resurgence of imperialism in the foreign policies of the great powers of Europe.
More तत्काल, the assassination of Archduke फ्रांज Ferdinand of ऑस्ट्रिया, the heir to the सिंहासन of Austria-Hungary, on 28 June 1914 by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary subsequently delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia.
Several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked.
Within weeks, the major powers were at war and, via their colonies, the conflict soon spread around the world.
On 28 July, the Austro-Hungarians fired the first गोलियाँ of the युद्ध as preparation for the invasion of Serbia.
जबकि the Russians mobilised, the Germans invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg on the रास्ता to France, providing a casus belli for Britain 's declaration of war विरूद्ध Germany.
After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt—the so-called Miracle of the Marne —the पश्चिमी Front settled into a static battle of अपघर्षण with a trench line that changed little until 1917.
On the Eastern Front, the Russian army was कामयाब against the austro-hungarians, but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the germans.
In November the उस्मानी Empire joined the war, opening up fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia and the Sinai.
Italy and Bulgaria गई to war in 1915 and Romania in 1916.
In Russia, the tsar 's government collapsed in March 1917 and a subsequent revolution in नवम्बर brought the Russians to terms with the Central शक्तियां.
After a 1918 German offensive along the पश्चिमी front, the allies drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives and American forces began entering the trenches.
जर्मनी, which had its अपना trouble with revolutionaries, agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918.
the war ended in victory for the Allies.
Events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts, as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic संसाधन to fight a total war.
By the end of the war, four major imperial powers—the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires—ceased to exist.
The successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory, while the latter two were dismantled entirely.
The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states.
The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another ऐसे conflict.
The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires, the repercussions of जर्मनी 's defeat and problems with the Treaty of Versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to World War II.

Afghanistan ( ; ; ), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked sovereign state forming part of South Asia, Central Asia, and to some extent पश्चिमी Asia.
It has a population of around 30 लाख inhabiting an क्षेत्रफल of approximately, making it the 42nd most populous and 41st largest स्वदेश in the world.
It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and the east, Iran in the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north, and China in the far northeast.
Afghanistan has been an ancient focal point of the रेशा Road and human migration.
Archaeologists have found evidence of इंसान habitation from as far back as the Middle Paleolithic.
Urban civilization may have begun in the area as early as 3,000 to 2,000 BCE.
Sitting at an important geostrategic location that connects the मध्य East culture with Central Asia and the Indian उपमहाद्वीप, the land has been home to various peoples through the आयु and witnessed many military campaigns, notably by Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and in modern era Western forces.
The land also served as a source from which the Greco-Bactrians, Kushans, Hephthalites, Saffarids, Ghaznavids, ghorids, Khiljis, Timurids, Mughals, Durranis, and others have risen to form major empires.
The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan begins in 1709, when the Hotaki राजवंश was established in Kandahar followed by Ahmad Shah Durrani 's rise to power in 1747.
In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the `` Great Game `` between the British और रूसी empires.
Following the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War, King Amanullah began a European style modernization of the country but was रोका by the ultra-conservatives.
During the ठंडा War, after the withdrawal of the British from neighboring India in 1947, the United States and the Soviet Union began spreading influences in Afghanistan, which led to a bloody war between the US-backed mujahideen forces and the Soviet-backed Afghan government in which over a लाख Afghans lost their जीवनदान.
This was followed by the 1990s civil war, the rise and fall of the extremist Taliban government and the 2001–present war.
In December 2001, the United राष्ट्र Security Council authorized the creation of the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) to help maintain security in Afghanistan and assist the Karzai administration.
Three decades of war made Afghanistan one of the world 's most dangerous countries, including the largest producer of refugees and asylum seekers.
While the international community is rebuilding war-torn Afghanistan, terrorist groups such as the Haqqani Network and Hezbi Islami are actively involved in a nationwide Taliban -led insurgency, which शामिल hundreds of assassinations and suicide attacks.
According to the United Nations, the insurgents were responsible for 80 % of civilian casualties in 2011 and 2012.
The American सिविल War ( ACW ), also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War ( देखिए naming ), थी a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States ( the `` Union '' or the `` North '' ) and several Southern slave states that declared उनके secession and formed the confederate States of America ( the `` Confederacy '' or the `` South '' ).
The war had its origin in the issue of slavery, especially the extension of slavery into the पश्चिमी territories.
Foreign powers did not intervene.
After four years of खूनी combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South 's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed, गुलामी was abolished, and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began.
In the 1860 presidential election, Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, opposed expanding slavery into संयुक्त States ' territories.
Lincoln won, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy.
Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal.
Lincoln 's inaugural address declared his प्रशासन would not initiate civil war.
Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession.
Confederate forces seized numerous संघीय forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy.
A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise, and both sides prepared for war.
The Confederates assumed that European देशों were so dependent on `` King Cotton `` that वे would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.
Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter, a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina.
Lincoln called for each state to provide सैनिकों to retake the fort ; consequently, four more slave states joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to eleven.
The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade कि crippled the southern economy.
the Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62.
The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland ( a Union राज्य ) ended with Confederate retreat at the बैटल of Antietam, dissuading British intervention.
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which made ending slavery a युद्ध goal.
To the west, by summer 1862 the Union नष्ट the confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, और the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River.
in 1863, Robert E. Lee 's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg.
Western successes led to ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864.
In the Western Theater, William T. Sherman drove ईस्ट to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea, destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way.
The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond, the Confederate capital.
the defending Confederate army failed, leading to Lee 's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.
The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars.
Railroads, the टेलीग्राफ, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively.
The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I.
It remains the deadliest युद्ध in अमरीकी history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties.
Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40.
Cost of goods sold ( COGS ) refer to the inventory costs of those goods a business has sold during a particular period.
Costs हैं associated with particular goods using one of several formulas, सहित specific identification, first-in first-out ( fifo ), or average cost.
Costs include all लागत of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and कंडीशन.
Costs of goods made by the business include material, labor, and allocated overhead.
The costs of those goods not yet sold are deferred as costs of inventory until the inventory is sold or written down in value.

Oklahoma ( ) ( Pawnee : Uukuhuúwa, Cayuga : Gahnawiyoˀgeh ) is a state located in West South Central संयुक्त States.
Oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 United States.
The राज्य 's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma, meaning `` red people '', and it is known informally by its nickname, The Sooner State.
Formed by the combination of ओक्लाहोमा Territory and भारतीय Territory on November 16, 1907, ओक्लाहोमा was the 46th state to enter the union.
Its residents are known as Oklahomans or, informally `` Okies '', and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.
A major producer of natural gas, oil, and agriculture, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, दूरसंचार, and biotechnology.
It has one of the fastest growing economies in the nation, ranking among the top राज्य in per capita income growth and सकल domestic उत्पाद growth.
Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma 's primary economic anchors, with nearly two thirds of Oklahomans living भीतर their metropolitan statistical areas.
With small mountain सीमाएँ, prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains and the U.S. Interior Highlands —a प्रदेश विशेषकर prone to severe weather.
In addition to having a prevalence of English, German, Scottish, Irish and देशी American ancestry, more than 25 Native American भाषाएं are spoken in Oklahoma, second only to California.
ओक्लाहोमा is located on a confluence of three major American cultural regions और historically परोसा as a route for cattle drives, a destination for southern settlers, and a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans.
Stacked and standing car tires
A tire ( or tyre ) is a ring-shaped covering that fits around a wheel 's rim to protect it and enable better vehicle performance.
Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, provide traction between the vehicle and the road while providing a लचीली cushion that absorbs shock.
The materials of modern pneumatic tires हैं synthetic rubber, प्राकृतिक rubber, fabric and wire, along with carbon black and other रासायनिक compounds.
They consist of a tread and a body.
The tread provides traction while the body provides containment for a मात्रा of compressed air.
Before rubber was developed, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and आंसू.
Early रबर tires were solid ( not pneumatic ).
Today, the majority of tires are न्यूमेटिक inflatable structures, comprising a doughnut-shaped देह of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion.
Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, including cars, bicycles, motorcycles, trucks, earthmovers, and वायुयान.
Metal tires हैं still used on locomotives and railcars, and solid rubber ( or अन्य polymer ) tires are still used in various non-automotive applications, such as some casters, carts, lawnmowers, and wheelbarrows.
Dr. Joseph Warren ( June 11, 1741 – June 17, 1775 ) was an American doctor who played a leading role in American Patriot organizations in Boston in early days of the American Revolution, eventually सेवारत as अध्यक्ष of the revolutionary Massachusetts Provincial Congress.
Warren enlisted Paul Revere and William Dawes on April 18, 1775, to leave Boston and spread the alarm that the British garrison in Boston थी setting out to raid the town of Concord and arrest rebel leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams.
Warren participated in the next दिन 's Battles of Lexington और Concord, which are commonly माना to be the opening engagements of the American Revolutionary War.
Warren था been commissioned a प्रमुख General in the colony 's militia shortly before the June 17, 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill.
Rather than exercising his रैंक, Warren served in the बैटल as a private soldier, and was killed in combat when British troops stormed the redoubt atop Breed 's Hill.
उसके मौत, immortalized in John trumbull 's painting, The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker 's Hill, June 17, 1775, galvanized the rebel forces, and he has been memorialized in many place names in the संयुक्त States.

These are organic charge-transfer complexes and various linear-backbone conductive polymers derived from polyacetylene.
Linear backbone organic semiconductors include polyacetylene itself और its डेरिवेटिव polypyrrole, and polyaniline.
At least locally, charge-transfer complexes often exhibit similar conduction mechanisms to inorganic semiconductors.
Such mechanisms arise from the presence of hole and electron conduction परतों separated by a band gap.
While such classic mechanisms are important locally, as with inorganic amorphous semiconductors, tunnelling, localized states, mobility gaps, and phonon -assisted hopping also significantly contribute to conduction, particularly in polyacetylenes.
Like inorganic semiconductors, organic semiconductors can be doped.
Organic semiconductors susceptible to doping such as polyaniline ( Ormecon ) and are also known as organic metals.
ठेठ current carriers in सशुल्क semiconductors are holes and electrons in π-bonds.
Almost all organic solids are insulators.
But when their constituent molecules have π-conjugate systems, electrons can move via π-electron cloud overlaps, especially by hopping, tunnelling and related mechanisms.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons और phthalocyanine salt crystals are उदाहरण of this type of सशुल्क semiconductor.
Mainly due to low mobility, even unpaired electrons may be stable in charge-transfer complexes.
Such unpaired electrons can function as current carriers.
This type of semiconductor is also obtained by pairing an electron donor molecule साथ an electron acceptor molecule.
Female ejaculation is the expulsion of fluid by human females इससे the paraurethral ducts through and around the female urethra during or before an orgasm.
it is also known colloquially as gushing or squirting, हालांकि these are considered to be different phenomena in some research publications.
The सटीक source और nature of the fluid continue to be a topic of debate among medical professionals, which is also related to doubts over the existence of the G-Spot.

The next World Cup will be hosted by Canada in 2015.
scorpions is a यंग adult novel written by Walter Dean Myers, first published in the United States by Harper & Row on June 20, 1988.
Front page of a 17th century Hebrew Bible by Joseph athias, now at Beth Hatefutsoth, Israel
'Son of man ' is the अनुवाद of various Hebrew and यूनानी phrases used in both the यहूदी Bible and the New वसीयत.
It has diverse meanings, ranging इससे a normal human being to a prophesied eternal, divine ruler.
The Hebrew expression `` son of man '' ( בן–אדם i.e. ben-'adam ) appears one hundred and सात times in the Hebrew Bible.
इस is the most common Hebrew construction for the singular but is used mostly in Ezekiel ( 93 times ) and 14 times elsewhere.
In thirty two मामले the phrase appears in intermediate plural form `` sons of men '', i.e. इंसान beings.
As generally interpreted by Jews, it denotes humankind generally.
in the Koine Greek of the New Testament, `` the son of man '' is invariably used as `` ὁ υἱὸς τοὺ ἀνθρώπου '' with a definite article.
The use of the definite article in `` the बेटे of man '' in the Christian gospels is novel, and before its use वहीँ, no records of its use in any of the surviving Greek documents of antiquity exist.
Geza Vermes has stated that `` the Son of man '' in the ईसाई gospels is unrelated to Hebrew Bible usages.
In Christian usage, unlike the Son of God title, which has been an essential तत्व of Christian creeds since the Apostolic age, the proclamation of `` Jesus as the Son of man '' has never been an article of faith in Christianity.
The interpretation of the use of `` the बेटे of man '' in the New Testament has remained challenging और बाद 150 years of debate no consensus on the समस्या has उभरा among scholars.
Master of foxhounds leads the field from Powderham Castle in Devon, England, साथ the hounds in front.
Fox hunting is an कार्यकलाप involving the tracking, chase, and sometimes killing of a fox, traditionally a red fox, by trained foxhounds or other scent hounds, and a समूह of निहत्थे अनुसरणकर्ता led by a master of foxhounds, who follow the hounds on foot or on horseback.
Fox hunting originated in the form practised until recently in the United Kingdom in the 16th century, but is practised all over the world, सहित in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy and the United States.
In Australia, the term also refers to the hunting of foxes with firearms similar to spotlighting or deer hunting.
In much of the world hunting in general is समझा to relate to कोई game animals or हथियार ( e.g., हिरण hunting साथ bow and arrow ) ; in Britain और Ireland, `` शिकार '' without qualification implies fox hunting ( or other forms of hunting साथ hounds- beagling, stag hunting, mink hunting, drag hunting or hunting the clean boot ) as described here.
The sport is controversial, particularly in the UK, where it was banned in Scotland in 2002, and in England and Wales in November 2004 ( law enforced from February 2005 ), though shooting foxes as vermin remained legal.
Proponents of fox hunting view it as an important part of rural culture and useful लिये reasons of conservation and pest control, while opponents argue that it is cruel and unnecessary.

The Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress ( also known as the Declaration of Colonial अधिकारों, or the Declaration of Rights ), was a statement adopted by the First Continental Congress on October 14, 1774, in response to the Intolerable अधिनियमों passed by the British Parliament.
The घोषणा outlined colonial objections to the Intolerable Acts, सूचीबद्ध a colonial विधेयक of rights, and provided a विस्तृत list of grievances.
It was similar to the Declaration of Rights and Grievances, passed by the Stamp Act Congress a decade earlier.
the Declaration concluded with an outline of Congress 's plans : to enter into a boycott of British trade ( the Continental Association ) until their grievances were redressed, to publish addresses to the people of Great Britain and British America, and to send a petition to the King.

The goldfish ( Carassius auratus auratus ) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes.
It was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is one of the सबसे commonly kept aquarium fish.
A relatively small member of the carp family ( which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp ), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a less-colorful कार्प ( Carassius auratus ) native to ईस्ट Asia.
It थी first domesticated in China more than a thousand years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been विकसित.
Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, देह shape, fin configuration and coloration ( various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black हैं known ).
Uncooked Rouladen
Rouladen ( or Rinderroulade, singular : roulade ) is a German meat roulade usually consisting of bacon, onions, mustard and pickles wrapped in thinly sliced beef which is then पकाया.
In some countries, the roulade is also known as `` beef olive ''.
Beef or veal is used as मांस though some food scholars tend to believe that the original version थी probably venison or pork, and pork is still popular in some areas.
The बीफ rouladen as we जान them today have become लोकप्रिय over the last century.
The cut is usually topside beef or silverside since this is the cheaper cut.
The more expensive version would be the round steak, also known as rump steak.
The meat is cut into विशाल, thin slices.
The filling is a mixture of smoked and cooked pork belly, chopped onions and chopped अचार ( gurken ) जिससे is at times varied by adding minced meat, sausage meat, pine nuts and mustard.
The mixture varies from region to region.
Rouladen are traditionally served for dinner.
रेड wine is often served with this dish.
Typical eukaryotic cell.
Cellular respiration is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ), and तब release waste products.
The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy in the प्रक्रम as weak so-called `` high-energy '' bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products.
Respiration is एक of the key ways a cell gains useful उर्जा to fuel cellular activity.
सेल्यूलर respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction.
The overall reaction is broken into many smaller ones जब it occurs in the body, most of which are redox reactions themselves.
Although technically, cellular respiration is a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell.
This difference is क्युकी it occurs in many separate steps.
While the overall reaction is a combustion reaction, no single reaction कि comprises it is a combustion reaction.
nutrients that are commonly used by animal and संयंत्र cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and a आम oxidizing agent ( electron acceptor ) is molecular ऑक्सीजन ( O2 ).
The energy stored in ATP ( its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form, thereby transferring energy for use by the cell ) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes.
Countries by 2011 GDP ( nominal ) according to the CIA World Factbook.
This article includes a list of countries in the world sorted by their gross domestic product ( GDP ), the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year.
The GDP dollar estimates presented here are calculated at market or सरकारी official exchange rates.
Several economies which are not considered to be countries ( world, the EU, and some dependent territories ) are included in the lists because they appear in the sources.
These economies are not ranked in the charts यहाँ, but are listed जहाँ applicable.
The figures presented here do not take into account मतभेद in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country 's करेंसी.
Such fluctuations may change a country 's ranking from one साल to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.
Therefore these figures should be प्रयुक्त with caution.
Some countries/regions may have नागरिकों which are on average wealthy.
These countries/regions could appear in this list as having a small GDP.
This would be because the country/region listed has a small population, and therefore small total economy ; the GDP is calculated as the जनसांख्यिकी times the wealth per capita.
Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity ( PPP ), to adjust for मतभेद in the cost of living in different countries.
( See List of countries by GDP ( PPP ) )
ppp largely removes the exchange rate problem, but has its own drawbacks ; it does not reflect the मान of आर्थिक output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than nominal GDP.
On the whole, PPP per capita figures are अधिक narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.
the पहला list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics प्रभाग for 2011.
The second list largely includes data ( estimate ) compiled by the International Monetary Fund लिये 2012.
The third list shows the World Bank 's mostly 2011 estimates, and the fourth list शामिल mostly 2012 estimates from the CIA World Factbook.
Lapping is a machining प्रक्रम, in which two surfaces are rubbed together साथ an abrasive between them, by hand गति or by way of a machine.
This can take two forms.
The first type of lapping ( traditionally called पीस ), typically involves rubbing a brittle सामग्री such as कांच against a surface such as आयरन or glass itself ( also known as the `` lap '' or grinding tool ) with an abrasive such as aluminum oxide, jeweller 's rouge, optician 's rouge, emery, silicon carbide, diamond, etc., in between them.
This produces microscopic conchoidal fractures as the abrasive rolls about between the two surfaces और removes material from both.
the other रूप of lapping involves a softer material such as pitch or a ceramic for the lap, which is `` charged '' with the abrasive.
The lap is then used to cut a harder material—the workpiece.
The abrasive embeds within the softer material which holds it and permits it to score across and cut the harder material.
Taken to a finer limit, this will produce a polished surface such as with a polishing cloth on an automobile, or a polishing cloth or polishing pitch upon glass or स्टील.
Taken to the ultimate limit, with the aid of accurate interferometry and specialized polishing machines or skilled hand polishing, lensmakers can produce surfaces that are flat to better than 30 nanometers.
This is one twentieth of the wavelength of light from the commonly used 632.8 nm helium neon laser light source.
Surfaces this flat can be molecularly bonded ( optically contacted ) by bringing them together under the right conditions.
( This is not the same as the wringing effect of जोहानसन blocks, although it is similar ).
The term `` America 's Team '' is a popular उपनाम in the United States that refers to the Dallas cowboys in the नेशनल Football League.

The President of the United States of America ( POTUS ) is the head of state and head of government of the United States.
The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the संयुक्त States Armed Forces.
Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests the executive power of the United States in the president and आरोप him with the निष्पादन of federal law, alongside the responsibility of appointing संघीय executive, राजनयिक, regulatory, and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers, with the advice and consent of the सीनेट.
The president is further सशक्त to grant federal pardons and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances.
Since the founding of the United States, the शक्ति of the president और the federal सरकारी have grown substantially and प्रत्येक modern president, despite possessing no formal legislative शक्तियां beyond signing or vetoing congressionally passed bills, is largely responsible for dictating the legislative कार्यसूची of उसके party and the foreign and domestic policy of the United राज्य.
The president is frequently described as the most powerful person in the world.
The president is indirectly निर्वाचित by the people through the Electoral College to a four-year term, and is एक of only two nationally elected federal officers, the other being the वाइस President of the United States.
The Twenty-second Amendment, adopted in 1951, prohibits anyone from ever होने elected to the प्रेसिडेंसी for a third full term.
It भी prohibits a person from being निर्वाचित to the प्रेसिडेंसी more than once if that person previously had served as president, or एक्टिंग अध्यक्ष, for more than two years of another person 's term as president.
In all, 43 individuals have served 55 four-year terms.
On जनवरी 20, 2009, Barack Obama became the 44th and वर्तमान president.
On नवम्बर 6, 2012, he was re-elected और is अनुसूचित to serve until January 20, 2017.

Map of the major rivers, lakes, and reservoirs in India
Map showing rivers and flood prone areas in India
Rivers of इण्डिया play an important role in the lives of the Indian people.
the river systems provide irrigation, potable water, cheap transportation, electricity, और the livelihoods for a large number of people all over the country and to rural areas.
This easily explains why nearly all the major शहरों of India are located by the बैंको of rivers.
The rivers भी have an important role in Hindu mythology and are considered holy by all Hindus in the country.
Seven major rivers along with their numerous tributaries make up the river system of India.
Most of the rivers pour their waters into the Bay of Bengal ; however, some of the rivers whose courses take them through the western part of the country और towards the east of the state of Himachal pradesh खाली into the Arabian Sea.
भाग of Ladakh, उत्तरी parts of the aravlli range and the arid parts of the थार Desert have inland drainage.
Dr.Francis Buchanan surveyed the courses of the rivers of India along with their tributaries and branches in 1810-11 AD and presented a minute account of it.
The shifting of the courses and bed over the centuries is very remarkable.
Many of the channels mentioned in कि survey have now become dead, dried or even extinct.
All major नदियाँ of India originate from one of the three main watersheds :

The Bretton Woods system of monetary management established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states in the mid-20th century.
The Bretton Woods system was the पहला example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relations among independent nation-states.
Preparing to rebuild the international economic system as World युद्ध ii was still raging, 730 delegates from all 44 Allied nations gathered at the Mount वॉशिंगटन Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, United States, for the संयुक्त Nations Monetary and Financial Conference.
The delegates deliberated during 1–22 July 1944, और signed the Agreement on its final day.
Setting up a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate the अंतरराष्ट्रीय monetary प्रणाली, the planners at Bretton Woods established the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ), जिससे today is भाग of the World Bank Group.
These organizations became operational in 1945 after a sufficient number of countries had ratified the agreement.
The chief features of the Bretton Woods system यहूद an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy कि maintained the exchange rate by tying its currency to the U.S. डालर and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments.
On 15 August 1971, the संयुक्त States unilaterally terminated convertibility of the US $ to सुनहरा.
This brought the Bretton Woods प्रणाली to an end and saw the dollar become fiat करेंसी.
This कार्रवाई, referred to as the Nixon shock, created the situation in which the United States dollar became a आरक्षित currency used by many states.
At the same time, many fixed currencies ( such as GBP, for example ), also became free floating.

A credit score is a numerical expression based on a statistical analysis of a person 's credit files, to represent the creditworthiness of that person.
A credit score is primarily based on credit report information typically sourced from credit bureaus.
Lenders, such as banks और credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the संभावित रिस्क posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt.
lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what interest rate, and what credit limits.
Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue.
The use of credit or identity scoring prior to authorizing access or granting क्रेडिट is an implementation of a विश्वसनीय system.
Credit scoring is नहीं limited to banks.
Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques.
Credit scoring also has a lot of overlap with data mining, which uses many similar techniques.
These techniques combine हज़ारों of factors but they are more or less similar or the same.
The seven SI base units और the interdependency of their definitions : for example, to extract the definition of the मीटर from the speed of लाइट, the definition of the second must be known while the ampere and candela are both dependent on the definition of energy which in turn is defined in terms of length, mass and time.
The अंतरराष्ट्रीय System of Units ( si ) defines seven units of measure as a basic set from which all other si units are derived.
These SI base units और their physical quantities are:
metre for length ( us English : meter )
kilogram for द्रव्यमान ( note : not the gram )
second लिये time
ampere for electric वर्तमान
kelvin for temperature
candela for luminous intensity
mole for the amount of पदार्थ.
The SI base quantities form a set of mutually independent dimensions as required by dimensional analysis commonly employed in science and technology.
However, in a given realization of these units वे may well be interdependent, i.e. defined in terms of each other.
The names of SI units are written in lowercase characters ( the 'degree Celsius ' meets this rule, as 'degree ' is the unit, and 'Celsius ' is a modifier ).
The symbols of units are written in lowercase ( e.g. metre has the symbol m ), except that symbols for units named after व्यक्तियों are written with an initial capital letter ( e.g., the hertz has the uppercase symbol Hz ).
Many other units, such as the litre ( US English : liter ), are formally not part of the SI, but are accepted for use साथ SI.

The September 11 attacks ( also referred to as September 11, सितंबर 11th, or 9/11 ) were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks launched by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda upon the United States in New York City and the Washington, D.C. area on September 11, 2001.
Four passenger airliners were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda आतंकवादी so they could be flown into buildings in suicide attacks.
Two of those planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of the World Trade Center complex in New York City.
Within two hours, both towers collapsed with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the WTC complex, as well as major damage to ten other विशाल surrounding structures.
A third plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was क्रैश into the प्रस्तुतीकरण ( the headquarters of the United States विभाग of Defense ), leading to a partial collapse in its western side.
the fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was targeted at the संयुक्त States Capitol in Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field near shanksville, Pennsylvania, after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers.

Geologists, compared to scientists engaged in अन्य fields, are generally more exposed to the outdoors than staying in laboratories ; although some geologists prefer to perform most of their studies in the lab.
Geologists are engaged in exploration for mining companies in search of metals, oils, and अन्य धरती resources.
They are also in the forefront of natural hazards and disasters warning and mitigation, studying earthquakes, volcanic activity, tsunamis, weather storms, and the like ; their अध्ययन are used to warn the सामान्य public of the occurrence of ये events.
Currently, geologists are also engaged in the discussion of climate बदलें, as वे study the history and evidence for this Earth process.

Modern vacuum tubes, ज़्यादातर miniature style
in electronics, a vacuum tube, electron tube ( in North America ), thermionic वाल्व, tube, or valve is a device controlling electric current through a vacuum in a sealed container.
The container is often thin transparent glass in a roughly cylindrical shape.
The simplest वैक्यूम ट्यूब, the diode, is essentially an incandescent light बल्ब with an added electrode inside.
When the bulb 's filament is heated white-hot, electrons are `` boiled '' off its surface and into the vacuum inside the bulb.
If the electrode -- called a `` plate '' or `` anode '' -- is made more positive than the hot filament, a direct current बहती through the vacuum to the electrode ( a demonstration of the Edison effect ).
As the current only flows in one direction, it makes it possible to convert an alternating current applied to the filament to direct current.
The परिचय of a third electrode, a ग्रिड between the filament and the plate, yields another function.
A voltage applied to the grid controls the current flowing from the filament to the plate.
Thus, it allows the device to be used as an electronic amplifier.
Vacuum tubes are thus प्रयुक्त for rectification, amplification, switching, or similar processing or creation of electrical signals.
The विशाल majority of modern day tubes consist of a sealed container with a vacuum inside, and essentially rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament.
Some exceptions to this are dealt with in the section about gas-filled tubes below.
Vacuum tubes were critical to the development of electronic technology, which drove the expansion and commercialization of radio broadcasting, television, radar, sound reinforcement, sound रिकॉर्डिंग and reproduction, large telephone संजाल, analog and digital computers, and industrial process control.
Although some अनुप्रयोग had counterparts using earlier technologies ऐसे as the spark gap transmitter or mechanical computers, it was the invention of the vacuum tube with three electrodes ( called a triode ) and its capability of electronic amplification that made these technologies widespread and practical.
In most अनुप्रयोग, solid-state devices such as transistors और other सेमीकंडक्टर devices have replaced tubes.
solid-state devices last longer and are smaller, अधिक efficient, more reliable, और cheaper than tubes.
Tubes can be fragile, sometimes generate significant unwanted heat, and can take many seconds—many minutes in critical applications—after powering on to warm to a temperature where they perform within operational tolerance.
However, tubes still find उपयोग जहाँ solid-state devices have not been developed, are अव्यवहारिक, or where a tube रै superior performance, as with some devices in professional audio and high-power रेडियो ट्रांसमीटरों.
Tubes are still produced for such applications.
Tubes are less संभावित than semiconductor डिवाइस to be destroyed by the इलेक्ट्रोमैग्नेटिक pulse produced by nuclear explosions और geomagnetic storms produced by giant solar flares.

Churchill was born into an aristocratic family as the grandson of the 7th Duke of Marlborough.
His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was a charismatic politician जो served as Chancellor of the Exchequer ; his mother, Jennie Jerome, was an American socialite.
As a young army officer, he saw action in British India, The Sudan, and the Second Boer War.
He gained fame as a war correspondent and wrote किताबे about his campaigns.
At the forefront of politics for fifty years, he held many political and cabinet positions.
Before the First World War, he served as President of the Board of Trade, Home Secretary, and First Lord of the Admiralty as part of the Asquith Liberal government.
During the war, he जारी as First Lord of the admiralty until the विनाशकारी Gallipoli Campaign caused his departure from government.
He then briefly resumed active army service on the Western Front as commander of the 6th Battalion of the Royal स्कॉट्स Fusiliers.
He returned to government as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, and Secretary of State for Air.
After the War, Churchill served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Conservative ( Baldwin ) government of 1924–29, controversially returning the पाउंड स्टर्लिंग in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy.
Also विवादास्पद was his opposition to increased home rule for India and his प्रतिरोध to the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII.
Out of office and politically `` in the wilderness '' during the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in warning about Nazi Germany and in campaigning for rearmament.
On the outbreak of the Second World War, he was again appointed First Lord of the Admiralty.
Following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain on 10 May 1940, Churchill became Prime Minister.
His steadfast refusal to consider defeat, surrender, or a compromise peace helped inspire British resistance, especially during the difficult early days of the War when Britain stood alone among यूरोपीय देशों in its active opposition to एडोल्फ Hitler.
Churchill was particularly noted for his speeches and radio broadcasts, which helped inspire the British people.
He led Britain as Prime Minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured.
After the Conservative Party lost the 1945 election, he became नेता of the Opposition to the Labour ( Attlee ) government.
After winning the 1951 election, he again became Prime Minister, before retiring in 1955.
Upon his death, Elizabeth ii granted him the honour of a state funeral, which देखी one of the largest assemblies of world statesmen in इतिहास.

An agar plate -- an example of a bacterial विकास medium.
specifically, it is a streak plate ; the orange lines and dots are formed by bacterial colonies.
A growth medium or culture medium is a liquid or gel designed to support the growth of microorganisms or cells, or small plants जैसे the moss Physcomitrella patens.
There are different types of media for growing different types of cells.
वहीँ are two major types of growth मीडिया : those used for cell culture, which use specific cell types derived from plants or पशु, and microbiological culture, जिससे are used for growing microorganisms, such as bacteria or yeast.
the most common growth media for microorganisms are nutrient broths and agar plates ; specialized media are sometimes required for microorganism and cell culture growth.
Some organisms, termed fastidious organisms, require specialized environments due to complex nutritional requirements.
Viruses, for उदाहरण, are obligate intracellular परजीवी and require a growth medium containing living cells.
A talent agent, or बुकिंग agent, is a person who finds jobs for actors, authors, film directors, musicians, models, producers, professional athletes, writers and other people in various entertainment businesses.
An एजेंट also defends, supports और promotes the interest of his/her clients.
Agents can not produce their own shows due to विरोध of ब्याज.
A talent agent must be familiar with their clients.
An agent has to know what kind of work the client can and can not do in order to मैच them साथ various jobs.
Having an agent is not required, but does सहायता the artist in getting jobs.
In many cases casting निर्देशकों, or other businesses, go to talent agencies to find artists वे हैं looking for.
The agent is paid a percentage of the star 's आय ( typically 10 % ).
Agents sometimes will be referred to as `` 10 percenters. ''
There are different regulations that govern different प्रकार of एजेंटों that are established by artist 's unions और the legal jurisdiction in जिससे the agent operates.
There are also professional organizations that license talent agencies.
Since the decline in viewership in theaters, from the 1950s to 1960s, this caused a स्मारकीय shift in how studios would produce films and thus reducing the cost of exclusive and expensive actors.
Actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity and so यहूद able to कार्य on within their time and with other studios.
क्युकी of this, agents यहूद now seen as a necessity instead of an option.
Agents now became third parties that negotiated between studios and clients, this making their services imperative between each party.
Since talent agencies हैं working with lucrative contracts, all talent agencies must be licensed under खास sections of the California Labor कोड, which calls an agent a `` person or corporation जो engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, होनहार, or attempting to procure employment for artist or कलाकारों. ''
Mars has two known moons, Phobos and Deimos, जिससे are thought to be captured asteroids.
Both satellites were discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall and are named after the characters Phobos ( panic/fear ) and Deimos ( terror/dread ) who, in Greek mythology, accompanied their father Ares, god of war, into battle.
Ares was known as Mars to the Romans.

In 2009 the Office of Personal Management asked संघीय agencies to stop requiring job आवेदकों to fill out the questionnaires, to be phased out within a year.
KSAs are brief and focused essays परिचय एक 's career and शैक्षणिक background that presumably qualify one to perform the कर्तव्य of the position being applied for.
A knowledge, skills, and abilities ( KSA ) is a concise essay about one 's talent and expertise and related experiences ( work, education, volunteer ) and accomplishments.
A series of KSA statements हैं usually required when applying लिये most federal government and some state and city government jobs.
KSAs are used as a गज to assess the capabilities of a prospective applicant in terms of likely ability to perform the duties of the job.
Most government hiring officials look for a short, कुरकुरे and clear KSA that emphasizes results or accomplishments obtained in previous कार्य.
KSA statements are also known as Evaluation Factors.
Other agencies sometimes call उन्हें `` Rating Factors '', `` Quality Ranking Factors '', `` Knowledge, Abilities, skills और Other Characteristics '', or `` Job Elements ''.
The name can be just a name लकिन often it influences content and length of the essay.
Every agency has its own regulations but most of the time the each KSA factor चाहिए be 1/2 to 11⁄2 pages long.

A variable-rate mortgage, adjustable-rate mortgage ( ARM ), or tracker mortgage is a mortgage loan with the interest rate on the note periodically adjusted based on an index which reflects the cost to the lender of borrowing on the credit markets.
The loan may be offered at the lender 's standard variable rate/ base rate.
There may be a direct and legally-defined link to the underlying index, but where the lender offers no specific link to the underlying market or index the rate can be changed at the lender 's discretion.
The term `` variable-rate mortgage '' is most common outside the United States, whilst in the United States, `` adjustable-rate mortgage '' is most common, and implies a mortgage regulated by the Federal government, with caps on charges.
In many countries, adjustable rate mortgages are the norm, and in such places, may simply be referred to as mortgages.
Among the most आम indices are the rates on 1-year constant-maturity Treasury ( CMT ) securities, the Cost of Funds Index ( COFI ), and the लंदन Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ).
A few lenders use their own cost of funds as an index, rather than using अन्य indices.
इस is done to ensure a steady हाशिया लिये the lender, whose own cost of funding will usually be related to the index.
नतीजतन, payments बना by the borrower may change over time with the changing interest rate ( alternatively, the term of the loan may change ).
This is distinct from the graduated payment mortgage, which offers changing भुगतान amounts लकिन a fixed interest rate.
Other फ़ॉर्म of mortgage loan include the interest only mortgage, the fixed rate mortgage, the negative amortization mortgage, and the balloon payment mortgage.
Adjustable rates transfer part of the interest rate risk इससे the lender to the borrower.
They can be used where मनमौजी interest rates make fixed rate loans मुश्किल to obtain.
The borrower benefits if the interest rate falls but loses if the interest rate increases.
The borrower benefits इससे reduced margins to the underlying cost of borrowing compared to fixed or capped rate mortgages.
The assassination of Robert Francis `` Bobby '' Kennedy, a United States सीनेटर and brother of assassinated President John Fitzgerald `` Jack '' Kennedy, took place shortly after मध्यरात्रि on June 5, 1968, in Los Angeles, California, during the campaign season for the United States अध्यक्षीय election, 1968.
After winning the California and South Dakota primary elections for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, Kennedy was shot as he walked through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel and died in the Good Samaritan Hospital twenty-six hours later.
Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian / Jordanian immigrant, was convicted of Kennedy 's murder and is सेवारत a life sentence for the crime.
Sirhan 's lawyers have released statements claiming evidence that he was framed.
The shooting was recorded on ऑडियो tape by a freelance newspaper reporter, and the aftermath was captured on film.
Kennedy 's body lay in repose at St. Patrick 's गिरजाघर in New York for two days before a funeral mass was held on June 8.
His body was interred निकट his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery.
His death prompted the protection of अध्यक्षीय candidates by the United States Secret Service.
Hubert Humphrey went on to win the Democratic nomination for the presidency, लकिन ultimately narrowly lost the election to Richard निक्सन.
As with his brother Jack 's death, Bobby 's assassination and the circumstances surrounding it have spawned a variety of conspiracy theories.
As of 2013 Kennedy remains one of only two sitting United States Senators to be assassinated ( the other being Huey Long ).
The Modern Age of Comic Books is an informal name for the काल in the history of mainstream अमरीकी comic books generally considered to last इससे the mid-1980s until present day.

a dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that is neither a ग्रह nor a उपग्रह.
More explicitly, the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) defines a dwarf ग्रह as a celestial body in direct orbit of the Sun that is massive enough for its आकार to be controlled by gravitation, लकिन that unlike a planet has not cleared its orbital region of अन्य objects.
The term dwarf planet was adopted in 2006 as part of a three-way categorization of bodies orbiting the Sun, brought about by an increase in discoveries of trans-Neptunian objects कि rivaled Pluto in size, and finally precipitated by the discovery of an even more massive object, Eris.
This classification states that bodies large enough to have cleared the neighbourhood of their orbit are defined as ग्रह, while those कि are not massive enough to be rounded by their own gravity are defined as छोटी Solar System bodies.
Dwarf planets come in between.
The exclusion of dwarf planets from the roster of planets by the IAU has been both praised and criticized ; it was said to be the `` right निर्णय '' by Mike Brown, who discovered and other new dwarf planets, but has been rejected by Alan Stern, who था coined the पद dwarf planet in 1990.
The IAU currently recognizes five बौना planets in the Solar System :, Pluto,,, and.
However, only two of these bodies, Ceres and Pluto, have been observed in enough detail to demonstrate that वे fit the definition.
eris रै been स्वीकृत as a dwarf planet because it is more massive than Pluto.
The IAU subsequently decided that unnamed trans-Neptunian objects with an निरपेक्ष magnitude brighter than +1 ( and hence a diameter of ≥838 km assuming a geometric ऐल्बीडो of ≤1 ) are to be named under the assumption that they हैं dwarf ग्रह.
The only two such वस्तुएँ ज्ञात at the time, Makemake and Haumea, went through this naming कार्यविधि और were declared to be dwarf ग्रह.
It is suspected that another hundred or so known objects in the Solar प्रणाली are dwarf planets.
Estimates are that up to 200 dwarf planets may be मिला when the entire region known as the Kuiper belt is explored, and that the number may exceed 10,000 when objects बिखरे outside the kuiper belt are considered.
Individual astronomers recognize several of these, and in August 2011 Mike Brown published a list of 390 candidate objects, ranging from `` nearly certain '' to `` possible '' dwarf planets. '
Brown identifies nine known objects – the five accepted by the IAU plus,,, and – as `` virtually निश्चित '', with another two dozen highly likely, and there are probably a hundred or so such objects in total.
The classification of bodies in other planetary systems with the characteristics of dwarf planets has नहीं been addressed.
A debit card ( also known as a बैंको card or जाँच card ) is a plastic payment card that provides the cardholder इलेक्ट्रॉनिक access to his or her bank account ( s ) at a financial institution.
Some cards have a stored value with which a payment is made, while most relay a message to the cardholder 's bank to withdraw funds इससे a payee 's designated bank account.
The card, where accepted, can be used instead of नकदी when making purchases.
In some cases, the primary account number is assigned exclusively for use on the Internet and there is no physical card.
In many देशों, the use of debit cards has become so फैली that their आवाज़ has overtaken or entirely replaced cheques and, in कुछ instances, cash transactions.
The development of debit ताश, unlike credit ताश and charge cards, रै generally महरूम country विशिष्ट resulting in a number of different systems around the world, which were often असंगत.
Since the mid-2000s, a number of initiatives have allowed debit cards issued in one country to be प्रयुक्त in other countries and allowed their use for अंतरजाल और फोन purchases.
Unlike credit और charge ताश, भुगतान using a debit card are तत्काल transferred from the cardholder 's designated bank account, instead of them paying the धन वापस at a later date.
Debit cards usually also allow for instant withdrawal of cash, acting as the ATM card for withdrawing cash.
Merchants may also offer cashback facilities to ग्राहक, where a customer can withdraw cash साथ with their purchase.
Francois Henri `` Jack '' LaLanne ( September 26, 1914 - January 23, 2011 ) was an American fitness, exercise, and nutritional expert and motivational speaker जो is sometimes called `` the godfather of fitness '' and the `` first fitness superhero. ''
He described himself as being a `` sugarholic '' and a `` junk food junkie '' until he was 15.
He also had behavioral problems, but `` turned his life around '' after listening to a public lecture by Paul Bragg, a well-known nutrition speaker.
During his career, he came to believe that the country 's overall health depended on the health of its population, writing कि `` शारीरिक culture and nutrition — is the salvation of America. ''
Decades before health and fitness began being promoted by celebrities like Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons, LaLanne थी already widely recognized लिये publicly preaching the health benefits of regular exercise and a good diet.
He published numerous books on फ़िटनेस और hosted a fitness television show between 1953 and 1985.
As जल्दी as 1936, at age 21, he opened one of the nation 's first फ़िटनेस gyms in Oakland, California, which became a prototype for dozens of similar gyms using his name.
One of his 1950s television कसरत programs was aimed toward women, whom he also encouraged to join his health clubs.
He invented a number of exercise machines, including leg-extension and pulley devices.
Besides producing his own series of videos, he coached the elderly और disabled नहीं to forgo exercise, believing it would enable them to enhance their strength.
LaLanne also gained recognition for his success as a bodybuilder, as well as for his prodigious feats of strength.
Arnold Schwarzenegger once stated, `` That Jack LaLanne 's an animal !, '' after LaLanne, at 54, beat a 21-year-old Schwarzenegger `` badly '' in an informal contest.
On the occasion of LaLanne 's death, Schwarzenegger credited LaLanne for being `` an apostle for fitness '' by inspiring `` अरबों all over the world to सजीव healthier lives, '' and, as governor of कैलिफ़ोर्निया, had earlier placed him on his राज्यपाल 's Council on Physical Fitness.
Steve Reeves credited LaLanne as his inspiration to build his muscular physique while keeping a slim कमर.
He was inducted to the California Hall of Fame and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of कीर्ति.

It थी the first Interstate Highway project in the संयुक्त States.
I-70 approximately traces the path of U.S. Route 40 ( and also the old National Road ) east of the Rocky Mountains.
West of the Rockies, the route of I-70 was derived from multiple sources.
I-70 is the fifth longest Interstate Highway, after I-90, I-80, i-40, and I-10.
the construction of I-70 in Colorado and Utah is considered an अभियान्त्रिकी marvel as the route passes through the Eisenhower Tunnel, Glenwood Canyon, और the सैन राफेल Swell.
The Eisenhower Tunnel is the highest point along the Interstate Highway system साथ an elevation of.
the भाग of the interstate in Missouri and Kansas have रखी claim to be the first interstate in the United States.
Though विवादित, the संघीय Highway Administration has claimed the section of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon, completed in 1992, was the last piece of the Interstate Highway प्रणाली, as originally planned, to open to traffic.
Photo of 1999 total eclipse
As seen इससे the Earth, a सौर eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and the Moon fully or partially blocks ( `` occults `` ) the Sun.
This can happen only at new moon, when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from धरती in an alignment referred to as syzygy.
in a कुल eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon.
In partial and annular eclipses only part of the Sun is obscured.
If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every single month.
However, the Moon 's कक्षा is inclined ( tilted ) at more than 5 degrees to Earth 's orbit around the Sun ( see ecliptic ) so its shadow at नई moon usually misses Earth.
Earth 's orbit is called the ecliptic plane as the Moon 's orbit must cross this plane in order लिये an eclipse ( both solar as well as lunar ) to occur.
In addition, the Moon 's actual orbit is elliptical, often taking it far enough away from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun totally.
The कक्षीय planes cross each year at a line of nodes resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occurring each year ; no more than two of which can be total eclipses.
However, total सौर eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on Earth 's surface traced by the Moon 's shadow or umbra.
An eclipse is a natural phenomenon.
Nevertheless, in some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses have been attributed to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens.
A कुल solar ग्रहण can be frightening to लोगों जो are unaware of its astronomical explanation, as the Sun seems to disappear during the day and the आसमान darkens in a matter of minutes.
Because it is dangerous to look directly at the Sun, observers should use special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques when viewing a partial eclipse, or the partial phases of a total eclipse.
It is सुरक्षित to view the total phase of a total solar eclipse with the unaided eye and without protection, however.
People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will सफर to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.
A political party ( from, Genitive partis, `` part '', `` portion '' ) is a political organization that typically seeks to influence, or entirely control, government policy, usually by nominating candidates with aligned political views and trying to seat them in राजनैतिक दफ्तर.
पार्टियों participate in electoral campaigns and educational outreach or विरोध actions.
Parties often espouse an विचारधारा or दृष्टि, expressed in a party program, bolstered by a written platform with विशिष्ट goals, forming a coalition among disparate interests.
The mango is a fleshy stone fruit belonging to the genus Mangifera, consisting of numerous tropical fruiting trees in the flowering plant family Anacardiaceae.
The mango is देशी to South एशिया, from where it has been distributed विश्वव्यापी to become एक of the most cultivated fruits in the tropics.
While other Mangifera species ( e.g. horse mango, M. foetida ) are also grown on a more localized basis, mangifera indica – the 'common आम ' or 'Indian आम ' – is the only mango tree commonly cultivated in many tropical और subtropical regions.
it is the national fruit of India, Pakistan and Philippines.

World मैप showing the Tropic of Cancer
The Tropic of Cancer, also referred to as the Northern tropic, is the circle of latitude on the Earth that marks the most northerly position at which the Sun may appear directly overhead at its zenith.
This इवेंट occurs once per year, at the time of the June solstice, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent.
it currently ( Year 2013 ) lies at 23° 26′ 15.143′′ north of the Equator.
इसके Southern Hemisphere counterpart, marking the most southerly position at which the Sun may appear directly overhead, is the Tropic of Capricorn.
These tropics are two of the five major degree measures or major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth, besides the Arctic and Antarctic Circles और the equator.
The positions of these circles of latitude ( other than the Equator ) are dictated by the tilt of the Earth 's axis of rotation relative to the plane of its orbit.
DVD-Video is a consumer video format used to स्टोर डिजिटल video on DVD discs, और is currently the dominant उपभोक्ता video format in Asia, North America, Europe, and Australia.
Discs using the DVD-Video specification require a DVD ड्राइव and an h.262/mpeg-2 Part 2 डिकोडर ( e.g., a DVD player, or a computer DVD drive with a software dvd player ).
Commercial dvd movies are encoded using a combination of H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 compressed video and audio of varying formats ( often multi-channel formats as described below ).
Typically, the data rate for DVD movies ranges from 3 mbit/s to 9.5 Mbit/s, and the bit rate is usually adaptive.
It was first available लिये retail around 1997.
The DVD-Video specification was created by DVD Forum and can be प्राप्त from DVD Format/Logo Licensing Corporation for a fee of $ 5,000.

In economics, this type of behavior is called `` free riding '' and is संबद्ध साथ the free rider problem.
Depending on context, leeching does not necessarily refer to illegal use of computer संसाधन, but often instead to greedy use according to etiquette : to wit, using too much of what is freely given without contributing a reasonable amount back to the community that provides it.
The नाम derives from the leech, an animal that sucks blood and then tries to leave unnoticed.

the United States Postal Service ( USPS ), also known as the Post Office and u.S. Mail, is an independent agency of the United States संघीय government जिम्मेदार for providing postal service in the United राज्य.
It is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the United States संविधान.
The USPS traces its roots to 1775 during the Second Continental Congress, where Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general.
The cabinet-level Post Office Department was created in 1792 from फ्रैंकलिन 's operation and रूपांतरित into its current form in 1971 under the Postal Reorganization Act.
The USPS employs over 574,000 workers and operates over 260,000 vehicles.
The usps is the operator of the largest vehicle fleet in the world.
The USPS is legally obligated to serve all Americans, regardless of भूगोल, at uniform price and quality.
The USPS has exclusive access to letter boxes marked `` U.S. Mail '' and personal letterboxes in the United States, but still competes against private package delivery services, such as UPS and FedEx.
The USPS has नहीं directly received taxpayer-dollars since the early 1980s with the minor exception of subsidies for costs संबद्ध with the disabled and overseas voters.
Since the 2006 all-time peak mail volume, बाद which Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act ``, ( which mandated $ 5.5 billion per year to be paid into an account to pre-fund retiree health-care, 75 years into the भविष्य, a requirement unique among organizations and businesses in the U.S. ), revenue dropped sharply due to recession-influenced declining mail volume, prompting the postal service to look to other sources of आय while cutting लागत to reduce its budget deficit.
Washington, D.C. has been the capital of the United राज्य since 1800.
Eight other cities have served as the meeting place for Congress and are therefore considered to have once been the capital of the संयुक्त States.
In addition, each of the 50 U.S. states and the five principal territories of the United States maintains इसके own capital.
Princess cut diamond set in a ring
the Princess cut is the second most popular cut shape for diamonds, next to a गोलाकार brilliant.
The face-up आकार of the princess cut is square or rectangular and the profile or side-on shape is similar to that of an inverted pyramid with चार beveled पहलू.
The princess cut is a relatively new diamond cut, having महरूम निर्मित in the 1960s.
It has gained in लोकप्रियता in recent years as a more distinctive alternative to the more popular round brilliant cut, in which the top of diamond, called the crown, is काटें with a round face-up आकार and the bottom, called the pavilion, is तराशा similar to a cone.
a princess cut with the वही width as the diameter of a round brilliant will weigh अधिक as it has four corners which होता otherwise have been cut off and rounded to form a गोलाकार brilliant.
The princess cut is sometimes referred to as a वर्गाकार modified brilliant.
However, while displaying the same high degree of brilliance, its faceting style is unique and completely different from that of a round brilliant.
the राजकुमारी cut had its origins in the early `` French '' cut, having a step-modified `` Double-French '' or `` Cross '' cut crown and a series of unique, chevron-shaped facets in the pavilion which combine to give a पृथक cross-shaped reflection when the स्टोन is viewed सीधे through the table.
Effectively, the Princess cut combines the high degree of light return of a round brilliant cut with a distinctive square or rectangular shape.
The square princess cut diamond is प्रायः slightly cheaper than round शानदार cut diamonds of the same कैरेट weight because it retains about 80 % of the rough diamond, as opposed to the round brilliant which retains only about 50 % of the rough.
The ability to retain more crystal weight makes this shape popular amongst diamond cutters.
Accredited Gem Appraisers ( AGA ) and American Gem समाज Laboratory ( AGSL ) and European gem Laboratories-USA ( EGL-USA ) हैं currently the only labs that ग्रेड the Princess काटें for cut.
There is no universal definition of what measurements make an ideal राजकुमारी cut diamond and अनेक diamond manufacturers market ideal diamonds with differing facet patterns and angles as `` ideal cut ''.
In contrast to the AGSL, AGA, and EGL-USA the Gemological Institute of America ( GIA ) रै stated that there is not enough industry consensus or अनुभवजन्य data to specify cut grading standards for Princess cut diamonds and to do so is at the risk of consumers who may be deceived by diamonds accompanied by unqualified Ideal or Excellent cut grades.
The name `` Princess Cut '' was originally used in connection with another diamond cut, वरना known as the `` प्रोफ़ाइल '' cut, designed by Arpad Nagy, a London cutter, in 1961.
The same name was बाद used and made popular by Ygal Perlman, Betzalel Ambar, और Israel Itzkowitz in Israel in 1979.
A similar cut with only 49 facets, as opposed to the original 58 facets of the princess cut, थी later branded the `` Quadrillion '' and initially distributed by Ambar Diamonds in लॉस Angeles.
Three years of optical research yielded a square स्टोन with faceting similar to that of a round brilliant cut diamond.
A तुलना
the number of chevrons can affect the overall outlook of a princess cut डायमंड.
This can usually be संकल्पित by the wire diagram that is plotted in diamond grading reports.
By adding more chevrons on the pavilion side of the diamond, the individual facets of the डायमंड will अभी be broken down into smaller facets.
As a परिणाम, it can give a princess cut diamond a `` crushed ice '' look.
Vice versa, when a राजकुमारी cut diamond has lesser chevrons, it tends to give the diamond a chunky outlook due to broader facets.
The domestic dog ( Canis lupus familiaris ) is a subspecies of the gray wolf ( Canis lupus ), a member of the Canidae family of the mammalian अनुक्रम Carnivora.
The term `` domestic श्वान '' is generally used for दोनो domesticated and feral varieties.
The dog has महरूम the पहला animal to be domesticated and has been the most widely kept working, hunting, and pet एनिमल in human history.
The word `` dog '' may also mean the male of a canine species, as opposed to the word `` bitch '' for the female of the species.
MtDNA evidence shows an evolutionary विभाजित between the modern dog 's lineage और the modern wolf 's lineage around 100,000 years ago but,, the oldest fossil specimens genetically linked to the modern dog 's lineage date to approximately 33,000-36,000 years ago.
Dogs ' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world संस्कृतियों.
Dogs perform many roles for people, such as शिकार, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals.
This impact on human society has given them the nickname `` Man 's बेहतरीन Friend '' in the Western world.
In some cultures, dogs are also a source of meat.
In 2001, there were estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.
Most breeds of dogs are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and व्यवहार by लोगों for specific functional roles.
Through this selective प्रजनन, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.
For example, height measured to the withers ranges from in the Chihuahua to about in the Irish Wolfhound ; color varies from white through grays ( usually पुकारा `` blue '' ) to black, and browns from लाइट ( tan ) to dark ( `` red '' or `` chocolate '' ) in a wide variation of patterns ; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.
It is common for most breeds to shed इस coat.
Diagram of a हस्तांतरण electron microscope
A 1973 Siemens electron microscope, Musée des Arts et Métiers, Paris
an electron microscope ( EM ) is a प्रकार of microscope that uses an electron beam to illuminate a specimen and produce a magnified image.
an EM has greater resolving power than a लाइट microscope और can reveal the structure of smaller objects because electrons have wavelengths परिचय 100,000 times shorter than visible light photons.
They can achieve better than 50 pm resolution and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000x whereas ordinary, non-confocal light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200 nm resolution and उपयोगी magnifications नीचे 2000x.
The electron microscope uses electrostatic and electromagnetic lenses to कंट्रोल the electron beam and focus it to रूप an image.
These electron optical lenses are analogous to the glass lenses of a light optical सूक्ष्मदर्शी.
Electron microscopes are used to investigate the ultrastructure of a wide range of biological और inorganic specimens including microorganisms, cells, large molecules, biopsy samples, metals, and crystals.
industrially, the electron microscope is often used for quality control and failure analysis.
Modern electron microscopes produce इलेक्ट्रॉन micrographs, using specialized digital cameras or frame grabbers to capture the image.

He was a leader of the Republican पार्टी and संस्थापक of the first incarnation of the short-lived Progressive ( `` Bull Moose '' ) Party of 1912.
Before becoming President, he held offices at the city, state, and federal levels.
Roosevelt 's achievements as a naturalist, explorer, hunter, author, and soldier are as much a part of his fame as कोई दफ्तर he held as a politician.
Roosevelt was 42 years old when sworn in as President of the संयुक्त States in 1901, बनाना him the youngest president ever ; he ताल out the youngest elected president, जॉन F. Kennedy, by only one year.
Roosevelt थी also the first of only three बैठे राष्ट्रपतियों to have won the Nobel Peace Prize.

To overcome his physical weakness, he embraced a strenuous life.
Home-schooled, he became an eager student of प्रकृति.
He attended Harvard University, where he studied biology, boxed and developed an interest in naval affairs.

Three types of cell division
Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or अधिक daughter cells.
Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle.
In eukaryotes, there are two distinct type of cell division : a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell ( mitosis ), and a reductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half, to produce haploid gametes ( meiosis ).
Both of these cell division cycles are required in sexually reproducing organisms at some point in उनके life cycle, and both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor Prokaryotes भी undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission, where their genetic material is segregated बराबर into two daughter cells.
All cell divisions, regardless of organism, are preceded by a single round of डीएनए replication.
For simple unicellular organisms such as the amoeba, one कोशिका प्रभाग is equivalent to reproduction – an entire new organism is created.
On a larger स्केल, mitotic cell division can create progeny from multicellular organisms, such as plants कि grow from cuttings.
Cell division also enables sexually reproducing जीवों to develop from the one-celled zygote, which itself was produced by cell division from gametes.
And after growth, कोशिका प्रभाग allows for continual construction and repair of the organism.
A human being 's body experiences about 10,000 trillion cell divisions in a lifetime.
Cell division has been modeled by finite subdivision rules.
The प्राथमिक concern of कोशिका division is the maintenance of the original cell 's genome.
Before प्रभाग can occur, the genomic information कि is stored in chromosomes must be replicated, and the duplicated genome must be separated cleanly between cells.
A great deal of सेल्यूलर infrastructure is involved in keeping genomic information consistent between `` generations ''.

The International Isle of man TT ( Tourist Trophy ) Race is a motorcycle racing event held on the Isle of Man और was for many years the most prestigious मोटरसाइकिल race in the world.
The event was part of the FIM Motorcycle Grand Prix World चैंपियनशिप during the period 1949–1976 before being transferred to the संयुक्त Kingdom after सुरक्षा concerns and run by the FIM as the British Grand Prix for the 1977 season.
The Isle of Man TT Races became part of the TT Formula 1 Championship from 1977 to 1990 to preserve the event 's racing status.
From 1989 the racing has been developed by the Isle of man Department of Tourism as the Isle of Man TT Festival.
The race is run in a time-trial format on पब्लिक roads closed लिये racing by the provisions of an Act of Tynwald ( the parliament of the Isle of Man ).
The पहला race was held on Tuesday 28 May 1907 and was called the International Auto-Cycle Tourist Trophy.
The event was organised by the Auto-Cycle Club over 10 laps of the St John 's छोटी Course of 15 miles 1,470 yards for road-legal touring मोटरसाइकिल with exhaust silencers, saddles, pedals and mud-guards.
The winner of the single-cylinder class, and overall winner of the first event in 1907, was Charlie Collier riding a Matchless motorcycle in a time of 4 hours, 8 minutes and 8 सेकेंड at an average race speed of 38.21 mph.
The winner of the twin-cylinder class was Rem Fowler riding a Peugeot engined Norton in a time of 4 hours 21 minutes and 52 seconds at an average race speed of 36.21 mph.
The trophy presented to Charlie Collier as the winner of the 1907 Isle of Man TT Race, was donated by the Marquis de Mouzilly St. Mars.
It featured a stylised version of Olympic God Hermes by Giovanni Da Bologna as a silver figurine astride a winged wheel.
The trophy was similar in design to the 18 carat gold montague Trophy प्रस्तुत to John Napier ( Arrol-Johnston ) as the inaugural winner of the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy car race in 1905 now known as the RAC Tourist Trophy.
The Marquis de Mouzilly St. Mars Trophy is now presented annually to the winner of the Isle of Man Senior tt Motor-Cycle Race.
The 2007 Isle of Man tt was the Centenary event which ran between 26 May and 8 June 2007 and प्रदर्शित a special Re-enactment of the 1907 Isle of Man TT Race held on the village green अगला to Tynwald Hill in st John 's on सोमवार 28 May 2007.
the vintage parade of 100 classic motorcycles for the Centenary Re-enactment on the original St John 's छोटी Course was flagged away by पूर्व World Motor-Cycle Champion Geoff Duke.
The पहला of the participants to be flagged away was the recently restored twin-cylinder Peugeot-Norton ridden by Rem fowler during the first Isle of Man TT Race in 1907.
भी participating in the 2007 Re-enactment was TT रेस competitor Guy Martin सवारी a 1938 Triumph Tiger 100 500 cc and other former TT competitors सहित Alan Cathcart, Sammy Miller, Nick Jefferies and Mick Grant also completed the Re-enactment lap.

Unemployment ( or joblessness ) occurs जब people are without work and actively seeking work.
The unemployment rate is a माप of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force.
During periods of recession, an economy usually experiences a अपेक्षाकृत ऊँची unemployment rate.
according to International Labour Organization report, more than 197 million लोगों globally are out of work or 6 % of the world 's workforce were without a job in 2012.
वहीँ remains considerable theoretical बहस regarding the causes, consequences and solutions for unemployment.
Classical economics, New classical economics, and the Austrian School of economics argue कि market mechanisms are reliable means of resolving unemployment.
ये theories argue against interventions imposed on the labor market from the outside, such as unionization, minimum wage laws, taxes, and other regulations that they claim discourage the hiring of workers.
Keynesian अर्थशास्त्र emphasizes the cyclical nature of unemployment and recommends government interventions in the economy that it दावा will reduce unemployment दौरान recessions.
This theory focuses on recurrent shocks that suddenly reduce aggregate demand for goods and services and thus reduce demand for workers.
Keynesian models recommend government interventions designed to increase demand for workers ; these can include financial stimuli, publicly funded job creation, and expansionist monetary policies.
In addition to these comprehensive theories of unemployment, there are a few categorizations of unemployment that are used to more precisely model the effects of unemployment within the economic system.
The main types of unemployment include structural बेरोजगारी which focuses on structural problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labour markets, including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets.
Structural वितर्क emphasize कल्याणकारी and solutions related to disruptive technologies and globalization.
Discussions of frictional unemployment focus on voluntary decisions to कार्य आधारित on प्रत्येक individuals ' valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates plus the time and effort required to find a job.
Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment प्रायः address job entry threshold and wage rates.
Behavioral economists highlight individual biases in decision making, and often involve problems and solutions concerning sticky wages and efficiency wages.
Collectivism is any philosophic, political, religious, economic, or social outlook that emphasizes the interdependence of every इंसान being in a society or civilization.
Collectivism is a basic cultural element that exists as the reverse of individualism in इंसान nature ( in the same way high context culture exists as the reverse of low context culture ).
collectivist orientations stress the importance of cohesion within social groups ( ऐसे as an `` in-group '', in कया विशिष्ट context it is पारिभाषित ) and in some cases, the priority of group goals over individual goals.
Collectivists often focus on community, society, nation or country.
It has महरूम used as an element in अनेक different and diverse types of government and political, economic और educational philosophies throughout history और most human societies in practice contain elements of both individualism and collectivism.
Some examples of collectivist संस्कृतियों include India and Japan.
Collectivism can be divided into horizontal collectivism and vertical collectivism.
Horizontal collectivism stresses collective decision-making among equal individuals, and is thus प्रायः आधारित on decentralization and egalitarianism.
Vertical collectivism is based on hierarchical structures of power and on moral and cultural conformity, and is therefore based on centralization and hierarchy.
A cooperative enterprise would be an example of horizontal collectivism, whereas a military hierarchy would be an example of vertical collectivism.
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ( ADEM ) is an immune mediated disease of the brain.
It usually occurs following a viral infection but may appear following vaccination, bacterial or parasitic infection, or even appear spontaneously.
As it involves autoimmune demyelination, it is similar to multiple sclerosis, and is considered part of the Multiple sclerosis borderline diseases.
The incidence rate is about 8 per 1,000,000 people प्रति year.
Although it occurs in all ages, most reported cases are in children and adolescents, with the average age around 5 to 8 years old.
The mortality rate may be as high as 5 %, full recovery is seen in 50 to 75 % of cases, while up to 70 to 90 % recover with कुछ minor residual disability.
The औसत time to recover is one to छह months.
ADEM produces अनेक inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord, particularly in the white matter.
Usually these are found in the subcortical and central श्वेत matter and cortical gray-white junction of both cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, और spinal cord, but periventricular श्वेत matter and gray पदार्थ of the cortex, thalami and basal ganglia may also be involved.
When the patient suffers more than एक demyelinating episode, it is called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis ( MDEM ).
The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the पाचन system which functions as an important organ of the digestive tract in कुछ animals, including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects ( mid-gut ), and molluscs.
It is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication ( चबाने ).
The पेट is located between the esophagus and the small intestine.
It secretes protein-digesting enzymes called protease and दमदार acids to aid in food digestion, ( sent to it via esophageal peristalsis ) through smooth muscular contortions ( called segmentation ) before sending partially पचता food ( chyme ) to the small intestines.
The word stomach is derived इससे the Latin stomachus which is derived from the Greek word stomachos ( στόμαχος ), ultimately from stoma ( ), `` mouth ''.
The words gastro- and gastric ( meaning related to the stomach ) are both निकला इससे the Greek word gaster ( ).
1940 Pontiac Special श्रेणी 25 Woodie
A woodie is a car body style, especially a स्टेशन wagon, where the rear bodywork is constructed of wood framework with infill panels of wood or painted metal.
After the demise of actual wood construction, manufacturers used simulated woodgrain sheet vinyl—sometimes augmented with three-dimensional, simulated framework—to recall wood construction.
in 2008, wood construction was evoked abstractly on the Ford Flex with a series of side और rear horizontal grooves.
A pearl is a hard object produced within the soft tissue ( specifically the mantle ) of a living shelled mollusc.
Just like the shell of a clam, a pearl is बना up of calcium carbonate in minute crystalline form, which has been deposited in concentric layers.
The ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth, but many other shapes of pearls ( baroque pearls ) occur.
The finest quality natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones और objects of beauty for many centuries, and because of this, the word pearl has become a metaphor for something very rare, fine, admirable, and मूल्यवान.
The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the जंगली, but they हैं extremely विरल.
These wild pearls are referred to as natural pearls.
Cultured or farmed मोती from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of those that are currently sold.
Imitation pearls are also widely sold in inexpensive jewelry, but the quality of their iridescence is usually very poor, and often, artificial pearls are easily distinguished from genuine pearls.
मोती have been harvested and cultivated primarily लिये use in jewelry, but in the past they यहूद also सिले onto lavish clothing.
Pearls have also been कुचल and used in cosmetics, medicines, and in paint formulations.
Whether wild or cultured, gem quality pearls are लगभग always nacreous and, as is the आंतरिक of the shell that produces them.
However, almost all species of shelled molluscs are capable of producing मोती ( formally referred to as `` calcareous concretions '' by some sources ) of lesser shine or less spherical shape.
Although these may also be legitimately referred to as `` मोती '' by gemological labs and also under U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules, and are formed in the same way, most of them have no value, except as curiosities.

In American football, each team रै eleven players on the फ़ील्ड at one time.
The specific भूमिका कि a खिलाड़ी takes on the field is called their position.
अंतर्गत the modern rules of American football, टीमों are allowed unlimited subsititutions, that is teams may change any number of players बाद any play.
This has resulted in the development of three `` platoons '' of players, the ठोकर ( the team with the ball, who is trying to score ), the defense ( the team trying to prevent the other team from scoring, and to take the ball from them ), and the special teams ( who खेल in kicking situations ).
Within those platoons, various specific स्थितियाँ exist depending on what the player 's main job is.
The Irish people ( or na hÉireannaigh ; Ulster-Scots : Airish fowk ) are an ethnic group who originate in Ireland, an island in northwestern यूरोपीय.
Ireland रै महरूम populated for around 9,000 years ( according to archaeological studies, see Prehistoric आयरलैंड ).
The Irish people 's earliest ancestors are recorded in महापुरूष – वे are claimed to be descended from groups such as the Nemedians, Fomorians, Fir Bolg, Tuatha Dé Danann and the Milesians.
Lebor Gabála Érenn, a book of Irish mythology tells that Milesians were Scythian descendants.
The main groups that interacted with the Irish in the Middle Ages include the Picts, Scots, और the Vikings.
Due to this contact, Icelanders are noted for having some Irish descent.
The Anglo-Norman आक्रमण of the High Middle Ages, the English plantations and the subsequent English rule of the country introduced the Normans and Flemish into Ireland.
Welsh, Picts, Bretons, और small parties of Gauls and भी anglo-saxons are known in आयरलैंड from much पहले टाइम्स.
There have been many notable आयरिश people throughout history.
The 6th century Irish monk and missionary Columbanus is regarded as एक of the `` fathers of Europe '', followed by Kilian of Würzburg and Vergilius of Salzburg.
The scientist Robert Boyle is considered the `` father of chemistry ``.
Famous Irish explorers include Brendan the Navigator, Robert McClure, Ernest Shackleton and Tom Crean.
By कुछ खाते, the first यूरोपीय child born in North America had Irish descent on both sides ; and an irishman was the first European to set foot on American soil in Columbus ' expedition of 1492.
वहीँ are descendants of Irish people जीना in many western countries, particularly in english-speaking countries.
Historically, emigration has been caused by politics, famine and economic issues.
An estimated 50 to 80 million people हैं descendants of Irish people, primarily in the United Kingdom, the संयुक्त States, Australia, Canada and Iceland ; there are also smaller numbers in Argentina, चिली, Mexico, जमैका, Barbados, South Africa, New Zealand, France, Germany and Brazil.
The largest number of वंशजों of Irish people live in the United States.
The number of people living in Australia who are of Irish descent is higher, as a percentage of total population, than that of कोई other country.
Approximately forty percent of the settlement population of Iceland came इससे Ireland or Scotland.
The very first inhabitants of Iceland were आयरिश.
the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) is a space telescope that was carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle in 1990 and remains in operation.
a aperture telescope in low Earth orbit, Hubble 's four प्रमुख instruments observe in the near ultraviolet, visible, और near infrared.
the telescope is नामित after the astronomer Edwin Hubble.
Hubble 's orbit outside the distortion of Earth 's माहौल allows it to take extremely sharp images with almost no background light.
Hubble 's Deep Field have been some of the most विस्तृत visible-light images ever, allowing a deep view into space and समय.
Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as accurately determining the rate of expansion of the ब्रह्मांड.
Although not the first space telescope, हबल is one of the largest and most बहुमुखी, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy.
The HST was built by the United States space agency NASA, with contributions from the European Space Agency, and is operated by the Space Telescope Science Institute.
The hst is one of NASA 's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray वेधशाला, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope.
Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923.
Hubble was funded in the 1970s, साथ a proposed launch in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the Challenger disaster.
When finally launched in 1990, scientists found that the main mirror had been मैदान incorrectly, compromising the telescope 's capabilities.
The दूरदर्शी was restored to its intended quality by a servicing मिशन in 1993.
Hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts.
Between 1993 and 2002, चार missions repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope ; a fifth mission was canceled on safety grounds following the Columbia disaster.
However, after spirited public discussion, NASA administrator Mike Griffin approved एक final servicing mission, completed in 2009 by Space शटल Atlantis.
The telescope is now expected to function until at तनिक 2013.
इसके scientific successor, the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ), is to be launched in 2018 or possibly later.
Anti-inflammatory refers to the property of a substance or treatment that reduces inflammation.
anti-inflammatory drugs make up about half of analgesics, remedying pain by reducing inflammation as opposed to opioids, which affect the central nervous system.
The Tonight Show is a US late-night talk show that has aired on NBC since 1954.
It is the longest currently running regularly scheduled entertainment program in the US and the third longest-running show on NBC after Meet the Press and आज.
The Tonight Show was hosted by Steve Allen ( 1954–1957 ), Jack Paar ( 1957–1962 ), Johnny Carson ( 1962–1992 ), Jay Leno ( 1992–2009, 2010–present ), and कोनन O'Brien ( 2009–2010 ).
Several guest hosts also appeared, particularly during the Paar and Carson eras.
The longest-serving मेजबान to date was Johnny Carson, who hosted The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson लिये 30 सीज़न from the fall of 1962 through the वसन्त of 1992.
The current host of the दिखाएँ is jay Leno, who had previously hosted the show from 1992 to 2009 और began his second tenure on March 1, 2010.
on April 3, 2013, NBC announced Jimmy Fallon would become the new host of The tonight Show.
The Tonight Show with Jimmy fallon will premiere February 24, 2014, the day after the closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.
SS एंड्रिया Doria.
Pronounced was an ocean liner for the Italian Line ( Società di navigazione Italia ) घर ported in Genoa, Italy, सबसे famous लिये its sinking in 1956, when 52 people died ( 51 from immediate impact ).
Named बाद the 16th-century Genoese admiral Andrea Doria, the ship had a gross register tonnage of 29,100 and a capacity of about 1,200 passengers and 500 क्रू.
For a country attempting to rebuild its economy and reputation after World War II, Andrea Doria was an icon of इतालवी national pride.
of सब Italy 's ships at the time, Andrea Doria was the largest, fastest and supposedly safest.
Launched on 16 June 1951, the ship undertook its maiden voyage on 14 January 1953.
On 25 July 1956, while the Andrea Doria was approaching the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, bound for New यॉर्क City, the eastbound of the स्वीडिश American Line collided with it in what became one of history 's most infamous maritime disasters.
struck in the side, the top-heavy एंड्रिया Doria immediately started to list severely to starboard, जिससे left half of its lifeboats unusable.
the consequent shortage of lifeboats might have resulted in significant loss of life, but the efficiency of the ship 's technical design allowed it to stay afloat for over 11 hours after the ramming.
The good बर्ताव of the crew, improvements in communications and the रैपिड जवाब of other ships averted a disaster similar in scale to that of the in 1912.
1,660 passengers and crew were rescued and survived, while 46 people died as a consequence of the collision.
The evacuated luxury लाइनर capsized and sank the following morning.
This accident remains the worst maritime disaster to occur in United States waters since the sinking of the in 1915.
The incident and its aftermath were heavily covered by the news मीडिया.
While the rescue efforts were दोनो successful and commendable, the cause of the collision with the Stockholm and the loss of Andrea Doria generated much interest in the media and many lawsuits.
Largely because of an out-of-court settlement agreement between the two shipping companies during hearings immediately after the disaster, no determination of the cause ( s ) was ever formally published.
Although greater blame appeared initially to fall on the Italian लाइनर, अधिक recent discoveries have indicated कि a misreading of रडार on the Swedish ship may have initiated the टक्कर कोर्स, leading to errors on both ships.
Andrea Doria was the last major transatlantic passenger vessel to डूबना before aircraft became the preferred method of travel.
Dialysis tubing
Dialysis tubing is a type of सेमi- or partially permeable membrane tubing made from regenerated cellulose or cellophane.
It can be used for diffusion साथ solutes or osmosis if used with जल only.
Osmosis is when water passes through a semi-permeable layer to reach equilibrium.
Diffusion, on the other hand, allows the movement of अणुओं from high concentration to कम concentration.
It will only allow molecules to pass through a semi-permeable membrane or layer if the molecule is छोटी enough to fit through the membrane or a membrane 's pore.
This usually results with the effects of diffusion through a membrane only really affects small अणुओं, and almost never larger molecules.
Dialysis tubing is used in clinical circumstances to ensure a filtered flow of molecules, preventing the flow of larger solute molecules.
Small molecules can be `` washed '' out of a solution which is pumped through the tubing into a solvent, usually water, which surrounds it and in which they can be flushed away.
In demonstrations of semi-permeable झिल्लियों, a solution containing several types of molecules, usually glucose and starch, is placed into a semi-permeable dialysis bag, such as a cellulose membrane with pores, and the bag is sealed with a गांठ or elastic band.
the sealed डायलिसिस bag is placed in a container of a different solution, or water.
Molecules small enough to pass through the tubing ( water, salts, monosaccharides, and other small molecules ) tend to move into or out of the dialysis bag in the direction of decreasing concentration, therefore displaying diffusion.
Larger अणुओं ( such as proteins, or polysaccharides ) that have dimensions significantly greater than the pore diameter are retained inside the dialysis bag.
The water and smaller solutes in a hypotonic समाधान ( a solution that has a lesser solute concentration than the solution it is संदर्भित to ) will cross a semi-permeable झिल्ली, like dialysis tubing, into a hypertonic solution ( a solution that has a higher solute concentration than the solution it is referenced to ) in an attempt to reach equilibrium, where the solute concentration of each solution is in संतुलन.
Mercury laboratory thermometer
A थर्मामीटर ( from the Greek, thermos, meaning `` hot '' and μἐτρον, metron, `` measure '' ) is a device that measures temperature or temperature gradient using a variety of different सिद्धान्त.
A thermometer has दो important elements : the temperature sensor ( e.g. the bulb on a mercury-in-glass thermometer ) in which some physical change occurs with temperature, plus some means of converting this physical change into a numerical value ( e.g. the दृश्य scale that is चिह्नित on a mercury-in-glass thermometer ).
There are many types and many uses लिये thermometers, as detailed below in sections of this article.
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a 1937 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney and released by RKO Radio Pictures.

The story was adapted by storyboard artists डोरोथी Ann रिक्त, Richard Creedon, Merrill De Maris, Otto Englander, Earl Hurd, Dick Rickard, Ted Sears and Webb Smith.
David Hand was the supervising director, while William cottrell, Wilfred Jackson, Larry Morey, Perce Pearce, and Ben sharpsteen directed the film 's individual sequences.
Snow White premiered at the Carthay वृत्त Theatre on December 21, 1937, followed by a nationwide release on February 4, 1938, and with international earnings of $ 8 million during its initial रिलीज briefly assumed the record of उच्चतम grossing ध्वनि फिल्मी at the time.
The popularity of the film has led to it being re-released theatrically many times, until its home video release in the 1990s.
Adjusted for inflation, it is one of the top ten performers at the North American box office.
At the 11th Academy Awards, Walt Disney was awarded an honorary Oscar, and the film was nominated for Best Musical Score.
It was added to the United राज्य नेशनल Film रजिस्ट्री in 1989 and is ranked in the अमरीकी Film Institute 's list of the 100 greatest American films, who also named the film as the greatest American animated film of सब time in 2008.
Disney 's take on the परी tale रै had a big cultural impact, resulting in a popular theme park attraction, a video game, and a Broadway musical.
Childbirth, labour, delivery, birth, partus, or parturition is the culmination of a pregnancy period साथ the expulsion of one or more newborn infants from a woman 's uterus.
The process of normal childbirth is categorized in three stages of labour : the shortening and dilation of the cervix, descent and birth of the infant, and birth of the placenta.
In many मामले and साथ increasing आवृत्ति, childbirth is achieved through induction of labor or caesarean section, which is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen, rather than through vaginal birth.
Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50 % in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006, and comprise nearly 32 % of births in the U.S. and Canada.
With respect to induced labor, more than 22 % of women undergo induction of labour in the United States.
Medical पेशेवर policy makers find that induced births and elective cesarean can be harmful to the fetus and neonate as well as नुकसानदेह or without benefit to the mother, and have established strict guidelines for non-medically indicated induced births and elective cesarean पहले 39 weeks.

The Atlanta Braves are a professional baseball team based in Atlanta.
the Braves are a member of the Eastern Division of Major League Baseball 's National League.
The Braves have played in टर्नर Field चूंकि 1997.
The `` braves '' name, which was first used in 1912, originates from a term for a Native अमरीकी warrior.
They are nicknamed `` the bravos '', and often referred to as `` अमेरिका 's Team `` in reference to the team 's games being broadcast on the nationally उपलब्धियाँ TBS from the 1970s until 2007, gaining a wide fanbase.
From 1991 to 2005 the Braves were one of the most successful franchises in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times in that period ( omitting the strike-shortened 1994 season in which there were no official division champions ).
The Braves won the NL West 1991–93 and the NL East 1995–2005, and returned to the playoffs as the National League Wild कार्ड in 2010.
The Braves advanced to the World Series five times in the 1990s, जीतना the शीर्षक in 1995.
Since उनके डेब्यू in the National League in 1876, the franchise has won 16 divisional शीर्षक, 17 National League pennants, as well as three World Series championships—in 1914 as the Boston Braves, in 1957 as the Milwaukee Braves, and in 1995 in Atlanta.
the Braves are the only MLB franchise to have won the World Series in तीन different home cities.
The club is one of the नेशनल लीग 's two remaining charter franchises ( the अन्य being the Chicago Cubs ) and was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1871 as the Boston Red stockings ( not to be उलझन with the American League 's बोस्टन Red Sox ).
They are considered `` the oldest continuously playing टोली in major North अमरीकी sports. ''
There is an argument as to who is actually older because although the Cubs हैं a full season `` older '' ( formed as the Chicago White stockings in 1870 ) Chicago lost two seasons to the Great Chicago Fire, thus the braves have played more consecutive seasons.
After various name changes ( such as the Boston Beaneaters ), the team operated as the Boston Braves for most of the first half of the 20th century.
In 1953, the team moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and became the Milwaukee Braves, followed by the मूव to अटलांटा in 1966.
The team 's tenure in Atlanta is famous for Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth 's career home run record in 1974, though the majority of आरोन 's home runs were hit जबकि the team was in Milwaukee.
His रिकार्ड stood until 2007, when सैन Francisco left क्षेत्ररक्षक Barry Bonds broke the record.
The leaves of a Beech tree
3D rendering of a μCT scan of a leaf piece, resolution circa 40 μm/ voxel.
A leaf is an organ of a vascular plant, as defined in botanical terms, and in particular in plant morphology.
Foliage is a mass noun that refers to leaves as a feature of plants.
Typically a leaf is a thin, flattened organ borne above ground and specialized for photosynthesis, but many प्रकार of leaves are adapted in ways almost unrecognisable in those terms : some are not flat ( for example many रसीले leaves and conifers ), some are not above ground ( such as bulb तराजू ), and some are without major photosynthetic function ( consider for example cataphylls, spines, and cotyledons ).
Conversely, many structures of non-vascular plants, or even of some lichens, which are not plants at all ( in the sense of being members of the kingdom Plantae ), do look and फलन much like leaves.
Furthermore, several structures found in vascular plants look like leaves but are नहीं दरअसल leaves ; वे differ from leaves in their structures and origins.
Examples include phyllodes, cladodes, and phylloclades.
Title card for the 1937 Our Gang comedy Rushin ' Ballet.
Our Gang ( also known as The Little Rascals or Hal Roach 's Rascals ) are a series of American comedy short films about a group of poor neighborhood children and their adventures.
Created by comedy producer Hal Roach, the श्रेणी is noted for showing children behaving in a relatively natural way, as Roach and original director Robert F. McGowan worked to film the unaffected, raw nuances apparent in regular children rather than have उन्हें imitate adult acting styles.
In addition, Our Gang notably put boys, girls, whites and blacks साथ in a group as equals, something that `` broke नई मैदान, '' according to film historian Leonard Maltin.
Such a thing had never been done before in cinema but has since महरूम दोहराया after the success of Our Gang.
The first production at the Roach studio in 1922 was a series of silent short subjects.
When Roach changed distributors from Pathé to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ( MGM ) in 1927, and converted the series to sound in 1929, the series took off even further.
Production continued at the Roach studio until 1938, when the series was sold to MGM, who then continued producing the comedies until 1944.
The Our Gang series includes a total of 220 shorts and one feature film, General Spanky, featuring over forty-one child actors.
As MGM retained the rights to the Our Gang trademark following their purchase of the production rights, the 80 Roach-produced `` टॉकीज़ '' were syndicated लिये television under the title The Little Rascals beginning in 1955.
Both Roach 's The Little Rascals package ( now स्वामित्व by CBS Television Distribution ) and MGM 's Our Gang package ( now स्वामित्व by warner Bros. Entertainment ) have since remained in syndication, with periodic नई productions based on the shorts surfacing over the years, including a 1994 Little Rascals feature film released by Universal तस्वीरें.
zacharias Janssen ( भी Zacharias Jansen or Sacharias Jansen ) ( b.1580-88, d.pre-1632 to 1638 ) was a Dutch spectacle-maker from Middelburg associated with the invention of the first optical telescope.
Janssen is sometimes also credited for inventing the पहला truly compound microscope.
However, the origin of the microscope, just like the origin of the दूरदर्शी, is a matter of debate.
Lake Tahoe ( ; Washo : dáʔaw ) is a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada of the United States.
At a surface elevation of, it is स्तिथ along the border between California and Nevada, west of Carson City.
Lake Tahoe is the largest alpine lake in North America.
Its गहराई is, making it the United State 's second-deepest ( the deepest is crater झील in Oregon, होने deeper, at ).
Additionally, Lake Tahoe is listed as the 26th largest lake by volume in the world at.
The lake was formed about 2 million years ago and is a भाग of the Lake Tahoe Basin with the modern झील being shaped during the ice आयु.
It is known for the clarity of its water and the panorama of surrounding mountains on all sides.
The area surrounding the lake is also referred to as Lake Tahoe, or simply Tahoe.
Lake Tahoe is a major tourist attraction in both Nevada and California.
It is home to a number of ski resorts, summer outdoor recreation, and tourist attractions.

Four Thirds logo
The Four Thirds प्रणाली is a standard created by Olympus and Kodak लिये digital single-lens reflex camera ( DSLR ) design and development. < ref name='DPReview.com 2001-02-13 ' >
the system provides a standard that, with digital cameras और lenses available from अनेक manufacturers, allows for the interchange of lenses and bodies from different manufacturers.
seems to cover the standard.
Proponents describe it as an open standard, लकिन companies may तभी use it under a non-disclosure agreement.
Unlike older SLR systems, Four तिहाई has been designed from the ground up to be entirely digital.
Many lenses are extensively computerized, to the पाइंट that Olympus offers firmware updates for many of them.
Lens design has been tailored to the requirements of digital sensors, most notably through telecentric designs.
The size of the sensor is significantly smaller than for most DSLRs and इस implies that lenses, especially telephoto lenses, can be smaller.
लिये example, a Four Thirds lens साथ a 300 mm focal length would cover about the same angle of view as a 600 mm focal length lens for the 35 mm film standard, and is correspondingly अधिक compact.
Thus, the Four Thirds System has crop factor ( focal length multiplier ) of about 2, and while this enables longer focal length for वृहद magnification, it करता n't aid the manufacture of wide angle lenses.
The image sensor format, generally intermediate between those of larger SLRs and छोटी compact cameras, generally gives levels of cost, performance and convenience intermediate between those दो वर्ग.
HVAC प्रणालियों use ventilation air ducts installed throughout a building to सप्लाई conditioned एयर to a room through आउटलेट vents, called diffusers ; and ducts to remove air through return-air grilles.
HVAC ( heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ) is the technology of indoor and automotive environmental comfort.
HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, based on the principles of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer.
Refrigeration is sometimes added to the field 's abbreviation as HVAC & R or HVACR, or ventilating is dropped as in HACR ( such as the designation of HACR-rated circuit breakers ).
HVAC is important in the design of medium to विशाल industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and in marine environments such as aquariums, where safe और healthy building शर्तें हैं regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.
Ventilation on the downdraught system, by impulsion, or the 'plenum ' principle, applied to schoolrooms ( 1899 )
Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning is based on inventions and discoveries made by निकोलय Lvov, Michael Faraday, Willis Carrier, Reuben Trane, James Joule, William Rankine, sadi Carnot, and many others.
The invention of the components of HVAC systems went hand-in-hand with the औद्योगिक revolution, and new methods of modernization, higher efficiency, and system control are constantly introduced by companies and inventors worldwide.
The three central functions of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning are interrelated, especially with the need to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor एयर quality within reasonable संस्थापना, operation, and maintenance costs.
HVAC systems can provide ventilation, reduce air infiltration, and maintain pressure relationships between spaces.
The अर्थात् of air delivery and removal from spaces is known as room air distribution.
The starting point in carrying out an estimate both लिये कूलिंग and heating depends on the exterior जलवायु and interior specified शर्तें.
However before taking up the heat load calculation, it is necessary to find fresh air requirements for प्रत्येक क्षेत्रफल in detail, as pressurization is an important consideration.
In modern buildings the design, installation, and control systems of these functions are integrated into one or more HVAC systems.
For बहुत small buildings, ठेकेदारों normally capacity engineer and select hvac systems and equipment.
For larger buildings, building services designers and engineers, such as mechanical, architectural, or building services engineers analyze, design, and specify the HVAC systems, and specialty mechanical contractors fabricate and commission them.
Building permits and code-compliance inspections of the installations are normally required for all sizes of buildings.
The hvac industry is a worldwide enterprise, with roles including operation and maintenance, system डिज़ाइन and construction, equipment manufacturing and sales, and in शिक्षा and research.
The HVAC industry was historically regulated by the manufacturers of HVAC equipment, लकिन regulating and standards संगठन such as HARDI, ASHRAE, SMACNA, ACCA, Uniform Mechanical कोड, International Mechanical Code, and AMCA have महरूम established to support the industry and encourage high standards and achievement.
Royal Navy Commander James Bond, CMG, rnvr, is a fictional character created by British पत्रकार and novelist Ian Fleming in 1953.
He is the protagonist of the जेम्स Bond series of novels, films, comics and video games.
फ्लेमिंग wrote twelve Bond novels and two short story collections before his death, हालांकि the last two books— The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights —were published मरणोपरांत.
The Bond अक्षर is a Secret सेवा agent, code number 007, residing in London but active internationally.
Bond was a composite character who was based on a number of commandos whom Fleming knew during उसके service in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, to whom Fleming added his own स्टाइल और a number of his own tastes ; Bond 's name was appropriated from American ornithologist James Bond.
Bond has a number of character traits which चलाएं throughout the books, सहित an enjoyment of cars, a love of food and drink, and an average intake of sixty custom-made cigarettes a दिन.
Since Fleming 's death in 1964, there have been other authorised writers of Bond material, including John Gardner, who wrote fourteen novels and two novelizations and Raymond Benson, who wrote six novels, three novelizations and three short stories.
There have also been three authors जो wrote एक book each, Kingsley Amis ( writing as रॉबर्ट Markham ), Sebastian Faulks and Jeffery Deaver.
Additionally a series of novels based on Bond 's youth— Young Bond —was written by Charlie higson.
As spin-offs from the literary works, there was a television adaptation of the first novel, Casino Royale, in which Bond was played as an American agent.
A comic strip series also ran in the Daily Express समाचारपत्र.

Louisiana ( or ;, ; Louisiana क्रियोल : Léta de la Lwizyàn ) is a state located in the southern region of the United States of अमेरिका.
Louisiana is the 31st most extensive and the 25th most populous of the 50 United States.
Its पूंजी is Baton Rouge and largest city is New Orleans.
Louisiana is the only state in the U.S. with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are local सरकारी 's equivalent to counties.
The largest parish by population is East Baton Rouge Parish, and the largest by land area is Cameron मोहल्ला.
Much of the state 's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas और vast areas of तटीय दलदल and swamp.
These contain a rich southern biota ; typical उदाहरण include birds such as ibis and egrets.
There are also many species of tree frogs, and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish.
In more elevated क्षेत्रों, fire is a प्राकृतिक process in the landscape, and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas.
These support an exceptionally large number of plant प्रजाति, including many species of orchids and carnivorous plants.
Some Louisiana urban environments have a multicultural, multilingual heritage, being so strongly influenced by an admixture of 18th-century French, Spanish, Native American ( Indian ) और African cultures that they are considered to be somewhat exceptional in the U.S.
Before the American खरीदें of the territory, the current Louisiana State had been both a Spanish और French colony.
In addition, the pattern of development included importing numerous African slaves in the 18th century, with many from the same प्रदेश of West Africa, thus concentrating their culture.
In the post-Civil War environment, anglo-americans increased the pressure for Anglicization, and in 1915, English was बना the only official language of the state.
Women 's अधिकारों are the अधिकारों and entitlements claimed लिये women and girls of many societies worldwide.
In some places these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behaviour, whereas in अन्य they may be ignored or suppressed.
They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls in पक्ष of men और boys.
Issues commonly associated with notions of महिलाओं 's rights include, though are not limited to, the right : to bodily integrity and autonomy ; to vote ( suffrage ) ; to hold public दफ्तर ; to work ; to fair wages or equal pay ; to own property ; to education ; to serve in the military or be conscripted ; to डालें into legal contracts ; and to have marital, parental and religious rights.
the laws of science or scientific कानून are कथन that describe, predict, and perhaps बताइये why, a range of phenomena behave as they appear to in nature.
The term `` law '' रै diverse usage in many cases : approximate, accurate, broad or narrow theories, in all natural scientific disciplines ( physics, chemistry, जीवविज्ञान, भूविज्ञान, astronomy etc. ).
An analogous term for a scientific law is a principle.
Scientific laws:
summarize a large collection of facts determined by experiment into a सिंगल statement,
can usually be formulated mathematically as one or several statements or equation, or at तनिक stated in a single sentence, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the initial, boundary, and other physical conditions of the processes which take place,
are strongly supported by empirical evidence - they are scientific knowledge कि experiments have repeatedly verified ( and never falsified ).
Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out, but बल्कि the scope of application, चूंकि the equation ( if any ) representing the law does not change.
As with other scientific knowledge, they do not have absolute certainty like mathematical theorems or identities, and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations.
are often quoted as a आधारभूत controlling influence rather than a description of observed facts.
I.e. `` the laws of motion require that ''
Laws differ इससे hypotheses और postulates, which हैं proposed during the scientific process before and during validation by experiment and observation.
These are not कानून since they have not been verified to the same degree और may not be sufficiently general, although वे may सीसे to the formulation of laws.
A विधि is a अधिक solidified and formal statement, distilled from repeated experiment.
Although the concepts of a law or principle in nature is borderline to philosophy, and presents the depth to जिससे गणित can describe nature, scientific laws are considered इससे a scientific perspective and follow the वैज्ञानिक method ; they `` serve their purpose '' rather than `` questioning reality '' ( philosophical ) or `` statements of logical absolution '' ( mathematical ).
For example, whether a law `` refers to reality '' is a philosophical issue, बल्कि than scientific.
Fundamentally, all scientific laws follow from physics, laws which occur in other sciences ultimately follow from physical laws.
Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, सार्वभौमिक constants emerge from scientific laws.

Abū al-Qāsim Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib ibn Hāshim ( ) ( circa| 570 – circa| 8 June 632 ), also transliterated as Muhammad ( ), was a धार्मिक, political, and military leader from Mecca जो unified Arabia into a single religious polity under Islam.
He is believed by Muslims and Bahá'ís to be a messenger and prophet of God.
Muhammad is almost universally माना by Muslims as the last prophet sent by God for mankind.
Non-Muslims regard मुहम्मद as the founder of Islam.
मुसलमान consider him to be the restorer of an unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam, नूह, Abraham, मूसा, Jesus, and other prophets.
Born in about 570 CE in the Arabian city of Mecca, he was orphaned at an early age and brought up under the care of his uncle Abu Talib.
he later worked mostly as a merchant, as well as a shepherd, and थी first married by age 25.
Being in the habit of periodically retreating to a गुफा in the surrounding mountains for several nights of seclusion and prayer, he later reported that it was there, at age 40, that he received his first revelation from God.
Three years after this event Muhammad started preaching ये revelations publicly, proclaiming that `` God is एक ``, that complete `` आत्मसमर्पण '' to Him ( lit.
islām ) is the only way ( dīn ) acceptable to परमेश्वर, and that he himself was a prophet and messenger of God, in the same vein as other Islamic prophets.
Muhammad gained few followers early on, and was met with hostility from some meccan tribes ; he and his followers यहूद treated harshly.
To एस्केप persecution, Muhammad sent some of his अनुसरणकर्ता to अबीसीनिया before he and his followers in Mecca migrated to Medina ( then known as Yathrib ) in the साल 622.
This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, which is भी known as the Hijri Calendar.
In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina.
After eight years of fighting with the Meccan tribes, his अनुसरणकर्ता, who by then had grown to 10,000, took control of Mecca in the largely peaceful Conquest of Mecca.
He destroyed the pagan idols in the city and then sent his अनुसरणकर्ता out to destroy all of the remaining pagan temples in Eastern Arabia.
in 632, a few months after returning to Medina from The Farewell Pilgrimage, Muhammad fell ill and died.
By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam, and he had united अरब into a single मुस्लिम धार्मिक polity.
The revelations ( or Ayah, lit.
`` Signs [ of God ] '' ) — which Muhammad reported receiving until his death – form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the `` Word of God '' and around which the धर्म is based.
Besides the Quran, Muhammad 's life ( sira ) and traditions ( sunnah ) are also upheld by Muslims as the sources of sharia law.
They discuss Muhammad and other prophets of Islam with reverence, adding the phrase peace be upon him whenever their names are mentioned.
While conceptions of Muhammad in medieval Christendom and premodern times यहूद largely negative, appraisals in modern history have been far less so.

The attack on Pearl Harbor ( पुकारा Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters ( Operation Z in planning ) and the Battle of पर्ल Harbor ) was a surprise military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United राज्य naval base at Pearl हार्बर, Hawaii, on the morning of December 7, 1941 ( December 8 in Japan ).
From the standpoint of the defenders, the attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time.
The attack was intended as a preventive कार्रवाई in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet इससे दखल with military actions the Empire of Japan थी planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States.
The base was attacked by 353 Japanese fighters, bombers and torpedo planes in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers.
सब eight U.S. Navy battleships यहूद क्षतिग्रस्त, with four being sunk.
Two of these यहूद later उठाया, and with the remaining four repaired, six battleships returned to service later in the war.
the Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer.
188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed ; 2,402 Americans were killed and 1,282 wounded.
Important base installations such as the power station, shipyard, maintenance, और fuel and torpedo भंडार facilities, as well as the पनडुब्बी piers and headquarters building ( also home of the intelligence section ) were not attacked.
Japanese नुकसान were light : 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, और 65 servicemen killed or wounded.
One Japanese sailor was captured.
The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and यूरोपीय theaters.
the following day ( December 8 ), the United राज्य declared war on Japan.
Domestic support लिये non-interventionism, which had been strong, disappeared.
Clandestine support of Britain ( for example the neutrality Patrol ) was replaced by active alliance.
Subsequent परिचालन by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to घोषित war on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day.
There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan.
However, the कमी of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led अध्यक्ष Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, `` a date which will live in infamy ``.
Project Runway Season 2 was the second season of Bravo 's successful Project Runway, a reality competition for fashion designers.
Season 2 began airing on December 7, 2005.

After the first challenge, called `` Road To The Runway '', fourteen went on to compete as finalists.
The winning designer, Chloe dao, received $ 100,000 in seed money to help launch her own line, a 2007 Saturn Sky roadster, a spread in ELLE magazine, and a mentorship साथ the Banana गणतंत्र Design Team.
Winning alongside dao was her model, Grace Kelsey, who received the ELLE Magazine spread.
Michael Kors and Nina Garcia returned as judges for the second season.
The fourth judging seat rotated each week, based on the चुनौती.
Tim Gunn, fashion chair at Parsons The New School for Design, returned as a mentor for the designers.
Kara Janx later appeared in Project Runway : All Stars in 2012, where she finished 7th out of 13.
andrae Gonzalo, in the same year, competed in the second season of the All Stars edition placing 10th out of 13.
An example of a Heraclius mule
In numismatics, a mule is a coin or medal minted with obverse and reverse designs not normally seen on the same piece.
These can be intentional or produced by error.
This type of error is highly sought after, and examples can fetch steep prices from collectors.
The earliest mules are found among ancient Greek and Roman coins.
Opinion is divided between those who think that they are accidental, the result of an incorrect combination of a new die with one that had officially been withdrawn from उपयोग, or the कार्य of coiners working with dies stolen from an official mint, perhaps at a time when one of them should have been destroyed.
The name derives इससे the खच्चर, the hybrid offspring of a घोड़ा और a donkey, due to such a coin having two sides intended for different coins, much as a mule has parents of two different प्रजाति.
This page documents the tornadoes और tornado outbreaks of 2010.
The majority of tornadoes form in the U.S., but they can occur almost anywhere अंतर्गत the right conditions.
A lesser number occur outside the U.S., most notably in parts of neighboring southern Canada during the Northern गोलार्ध 's summer season, लकिन are also known in South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
There were 1,531 tornadoes reported in the United States in 2010 ( of जिससे at तनिक 1,266 were confirmed ), with 45 पुष्टि fatalities.
elsewhere in the world, 11 people were मारे in tornadoes, छह in Argentina, three in the Bahamas, one in Bangladesh, and one in जर्मनी.

Windows PowerShell is microsoft 's task automation framework, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language built on.NET Framework.
powershell provides full access to COM and WMI, enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems.
In PowerShell, administrative tasks are generally performed by cmdlets ( pronounced command-lets ), which are specialized.NET classes implementing a particular operation.
Sets of cmdlets may be combined साथ in स्क्रिप्ट, executables ( जिससे are standalone applications ), or by instantiating regular.NET classes ( or WMI/COM Objects ).
These work by accessing data in different data stores, like the filesystem or registry, which are made available to the powershell runtime via Windows PowerShell providers.
Windows powershell also provides a hosting API with which the Windows PowerShell runtime can be embedded inside other applications.
These applications can then use Windows PowerShell functionality to implement certain operations, including those exposed via the graphical interface.
इस capability has been used by Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to expose its management functionality as PowerShell cmdlets and providers and implement the graphical प्रबन्धन tools as PowerShell hosts which invoke the necessary cmdlets.
Other Microsoft applications including Microsoft SQL Server 2008 also expose their management interface via PowerShell cmdlets.
With PowerShell, graphical interface-based management applications on Windows are परतदार on top of Windows PowerShell.
A PowerShell एनक्रिप्शन interface for खिड़कियाँ products is mandated by the Common Engineering Criteria.
Windows PowerShell includes its own extensive, console-based help, similar to man pages in Unix shells, via the Get-Help cmdlet.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her daughter, Harriot
Elizabeth Cady Stanton ( November 12, 1815 – October 26, 1902 ) was an American social activist, abolitionist, and leading figure of the early women 's rights movement.
Her Declaration of Sentiments, presented at the first women 's rights convention held in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New यॉर्क, is प्रायः credited with initiating the first organized women 's rights and women 's suffrage movements in the United States.

Religion in the United Kingdom and in the countries that preceded it, has been dominated, लिये over 1,400 years, by various forms of Christianity.
according to some surveys, a majority of citizens still identify साथ Christianity, although regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century, and immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of other faiths.
Religious affiliations of UK citizens are recorded by regular surveys, the four major ones being the UK Census, the Labour Force Survey, the British Social Attitudes survey and the European Social Survey.
According to the 2001 UK census, Christianity is the major religion, followed by Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, judaism and Buddhism in terms of number of adherents.
This, और the relatively large number of individuals with nominal or no religious affiliations has led commentators to variously describe the संयुक्त Kingdom as a multi-faith, secularised, or post-Christian समाज.
The संयुक्त Kingdom was formed by the union of previously independent countries from 1707, and consequently most of the largest religious groups do not have uk-wide organisational structures.
While some groups have separate structures for the individual countries of the United Kingdom, others may have a single structure covering England and वेल्स or Great Britain.
Similarly, due to the relatively recent creation of Northern Ireland in 1921, most major religious groups in Northern Ireland are organised on an all-Ireland आधार.

It involved सब the world 's great powers, जिससे were assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple entente of the United Kingdom, France and Russia ) and the सेंट्रल Powers ( originally the Triple गठबंधन of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy ; but, as Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive against the agreement, इटली did not enter into the war ).
These alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy, Japan और the United राज्य joined the Allies, and the उस्मानी Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers.
Ultimately, अधिक than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in एक of the largest wars in इतिहास.
More than 9 million combatants were killed, largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons बगैर corresponding improvements in protection or mobility.
It was the fifth- deadliest विरोध in world इतिहास, subsequently paving the way for विभिन्न political परिवर्तन, such as revolutions in many of the nations involved.
एक of the long-term causes of the war was the पुनरुत्थान of साम्राज्यवाद in the foreign policies of the great powers of Europe.

On the Eastern Front, the Russian army was successful against the austro-hungarians, but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the Germans.
In November the Ottoman Empire joined the war, opening up fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia and the sinai.
इटली और Bulgaria went to war in 1915 and रोमानिया in 1916.
In Russia, the त्सार 's government collapsed in March 1917 and a subsequent revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers.
After a 1918 German offensive along the western front, the Allies drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives and American forces began entering the trenches.
Germany, which had its own trouble with क्रांतिकारियों, agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918.
the war ended in victory for the Allies.
Events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts, as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a total युद्ध.
By the end of the war, four major इम्पीरियल powers—the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires—ceased to exist.
The successor states of the former two खोया a great amount of territory, while the latter two were dismantled entirely.
The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states.

It has a रूप of government characterized by single-party rule or dominant-party rule of a communist party ( referred as Dictatorship of the Proletariat by its proponents ) and a professed allegiance to a Leninist or Marxist–Leninist ideology as the guiding principle of the state.
Technically, `` communist state '' is a contradictio in terminis as a communist society as defined by both Marxists and anarcho-communists is in principle stateless.
From this perspective, the पद Marxist-Leninist state is more appropriate.
Historically, a `` communist state '' referred to a system where public ownership of all or most means of production by the Communist पार्टी -run state is deemed necessary to further the interests of the working class ; today, a communist state can also, लिये instance, refer to contemporary China and Vietnam, where a Communist Party-run state exists alongside a mixed economy.
According to marxist–leninists, the state is a tool in the hands of the ruling क्लास, which in a socialist society is the working class, so a socialist state is, according to Leninists, a state of the working class.
In practice, communist states do not actually refer to themselves as such.
They do this not to भेस the fact that the ruling party is कम्युनिस्ट, but rather because they do not consider themselves to be a communist society at present.
Instead, they constitutionally identify themselves as socialist states or workers ' states.
The primary लक्ष्य of ये states, जिससे also explains their आधिकारिक name, is to guide their respective countries in the process of building socialism, ultimately leading to communism.
Communist states may have अनेक legal political parties, but the communist party is usually granted a special or dominant role in government, often by statute or under the constitution.
Consequently, the संस्थानों of the state and of the communist party become intimately entwined, such as in the development of parallel institutions.
In the 20th century, सबसे communist states adopted नियोजित economies.
However, there were exceptions : The Soviet Union during the 1920s and late 1980s and Yugoslavia after World War ii allowed सीमित markets and a degree of worker self-management, while China, Vietnam and Laos introduced far-reaching market reforms after the 1980s.
In the 21st century, China and Vietnam have allowed a मिश्रित economy to develop.
The आधारभूत अवधारणाओं of कम्युनिस्ट states often diverge इससे the original socio-economic ideologies from which they develop.
As a result, many adherents of these ideologies often oppose the political systems commonly associated with these राज्य.
For उदाहरण, dissenting communists such as Trotskyists were often opposed to the communist states of the 20th century, claiming either that they had nothing to do with `` real '' communism or that the ideology of such states had reached a point of irrevocable corruption.

Slug is a common name लिये an apparently shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusk.
The word `` स्लग '' is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, has a very reduced shell, or has only a small internal shell.
( This is in contrast to the common name `` snail ``, which is applied to gastropods that have a coiled shell that is large enough कि the नरम parts of the एनिमल can retract fully into it. )
Slugs exist on land and in the sea, and there is even one genus of freshwater slugs, acochlidium.
The unadorned word `` slug '' is however applied primarily to जमीन slugs, whereas slugs from the sea or from freshwater हैं usually referred to as `` sea slugs `` and `` freshwater slugs ''.
Land gastropods with a shell that is not quite vestigial, but is too small to retract into ( like अनेक in the family Urocyclidae ), are known as semislugs.
The various taxonomic families of slugs form भाग of several quite different evolutionary lineages which also include snails.
Thus, for उदाहरण, the various families of land slugs are not बहुत closely related to one another, despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form.
the shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past, and thus the category `` slug '' is emphatically a polyphyletic one.
Slugs, like all other gastropods, undergo torsion ( a 180° twisting of the internal organs ) दौरान development.
Internally, slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation, but externally the bodies of land slugs appear to be अधिक or कम symmetrical, मगर for the positioning of the pneumostome, which is on one side of the animal, normally the right hand side.
The नरम, slimy bodies of slugs are prone to desiccation, so land-living slugs are confined to नम environments and must retreat to damp hiding places जब the weather is dry.
The subsequent information in this article applies to land slugs.

Imperial Standard of Napoleon I
Napoleon Bonaparte (, ; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821 ) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the French Revolution and its associated wars in Europe.
As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1815.
His legal reform, the Napoleonic Code, has been a major influence on many civil law jurisdictions worldwide, but he is best remembered for his role in the wars led against France by a series of coalitions, the so-called Napoleonic Wars.
He established hegemony over most of continental Europe and sought to spread the ideals of the French Revolution, while consolidating an imperial monarchy which restored पहलुओं of the deposed Ancien Régime.
Due to his success in these wars, often against numerically superior enemies, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest military commanders of all time, and his campaigns are studied at military academies worldwide.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica in a family of noble इतालवी ancestry which had settled corsica in the 16th century.
He trained as an artillery officer in mainland फ़्रांस.
He रोज़ to prominence under the French First Republic and led successful campaigns against the पहला और Second Coalitions arrayed against France.
He led a successful invasion of the Italian peninsula.
In 1799, he staged a coup d'état and installed himself as पहला Consul ; five सालो later the French Senate proclaimed him emperor, following a plebiscite in his favour.
In the first decade of the 19th century, the French Empire under Napoleon engaged in a series of conflicts—the Napoleonic Wars —that involved every major European power.
After a streak of victories, France secured a प्रबल position in महाद्वीपीय Europe, and Napoleon maintained the French sphere of influence through the formation of extensive alliances and the appointment of friends and family members to rule other European countries as French client states.
The Peninsular War and 1812 French invasion of Russia marked turning points in Napoleon 's fortunes.
His Grande Armée was badly damaged in the campaign and never fully recovered.
In 1813, the छठे Coalition defeated his forces at Leipzig ; the following year the Coalition invaded फ़्रांस, forced Napoleon to abdicate and exiled him to the island of Elba.
Less than a year later, he escaped Elba and returned to शक्ति, but was पराजित at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815.
Napoleon spent the last six years of his life in confinement by the British on the island of Saint हेलेना.
An autopsy concluded he died of stomach cancer, but there has been some debate about the cause of his death, as some scholars have speculated that he was a शिकार of arsenic poisoning.

An academic discipline, or field of study, is a शाखा of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university स्तर.
Disciplines are defined ( in part ), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic विभाग or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
However, there exists no formal criteria for when educational programs and scholarly journals form an academic discipline.
A huge difference exists between, on the one hand, well established disciplines that exist in almost all universities all over the world, have a long history, and have a well established set of journals and conferences, और, on the other hand, suggestions for new fields supported only by few universities and publications.
Fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, और the distinguishing lines between these हैं often both arbitrary and ambiguous.
पीएचपी is a server-side scripting language designed लिये web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.
PHP is now installed on more than 244 million websites and 2.1 million वेब servers.
Originally created by rasmus Lerdorf in 1995, the reference implementation of PHP is now produced by The PHP Group.
While पीएचपी originally stood लिये Personal Home Page, it now stands for PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor, a recursive acronym.
PHP code is interpreted by a web server with a PHP processor module which generates the resulting web page : PHP commands can be embedded directly into an HTML source document rather than कॉलिंग an external file to process data.
It has also evolved to include a command-line interface capability and can be used in standalone आलेखीय applications.
PHP is free software released under the PHP License, which is incompatible with the GNU General Public License ( जीपीएल ) due to restrictions on the usage of the term पीएचपी.

A metaphor is a figure of speech that describes a subject by asserting that it is, on some point of comparison, the same as another otherwise unrelated object.
रूपक is a type of analogy and is closely related to other rhetorical figures of वाक that achieve their effects via association, comparison or प्रतिरूप including allegory, अतिशयोक्ति, and simile.
In simpler terms, a metaphor compares two objects or things without using the words `` like '' or `` as ''.
One of the most prominent examples of a metaphor in English literature is the All the world 's a stage monologue from As तुम Like It :
All the world 's a stage,
And all the मेन and women merely players ;
They have their exits and their entrances ; — William Shakespeare, as You Like It, 2/7
This quote is a metaphor because the world is नहीं literally a stage.
By figuratively asserting that the world is a stage, Shakespeare uses the points of comparison between the world और a stage to convey an understanding about the mechanics of the world and the lives of the people within it.

Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing, normally on paper.
Printmaking normally covers only the प्रक्रम of creating prints with an तत्व of originality, rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting.
Except in the case of monotyping, the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is पुकारा a print.
प्रत्येक print produced is not considered a `` copy '' but rather is considered an `` original ''.
This is because typically each print varies to an extent due to variables intrinsic to the printmaking process, और also because the imagery of a print is typically not बस a reproduction of another work but बल्कि is often a unique चित्र designed इससे the start to be expressed in a particular printmaking technique.
A print may be known as an impression.
Printmaking ( other than monotyping ) is not chosen only लिये its ability to produce multiple impressions, but बल्कि for the unique qualities that each of the printmaking processes lends itself to.
Prints are created by transferring ink from a matrix or through a prepared screen to a sheet of paper or अन्य material.
Common types of matrices include : metal plates, usually copper or जस्ता, or polymer plates for engraving or etching ; stone, aluminum, or polymer for lithography ; ब्लॉक of लकडी for woodcuts and wood engravings ; and linoleum for linocuts.
Screens made of silk or सिंथेटिक fabrics are used for the screenprinting process.
अन्य types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below.
Multiple impressions printed from the same matrix form an edition.
Since the late 19th century, artists have generally signed व्यक्तिगत impressions from an edition and often number the impressions to form a limited edition.

Necrotizing fasciitis ( or ) or NF, commonly ज्ञात as flesh-eating disease or flesh-eating bacteria syndrome, is a rare infection of the deeper layers of स्किन and subcutaneous tissues, easily spreading across the fascial plane within the subcutaneous tissue.
necrotizing fasciitis is quickly progressing, having greater risk of developing in the immunocompromised due to conditions like diabetes, cancer, etc.
It is a severe बीमारी of sudden onset and is usually treated immediately with high doses of intravenous एंटीबायोटिक.
Type I describes a polymicrobial infection, whereas Type II describes a monomicrobial infection.
Many types of bacteria can cause necrotizing fasciitis ( e.g., Group A streptococcus ( Streptococcus pyogenes ), staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Aeromonas hydrophila ).
Such infections are more likely to occur in people with compromised immune systems.
Historically, Group A streptococcus made up most cases of Type II infections.
however, since as early as 2001, another serious form of monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis has been observed साथ increasing frequency, caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ).
Some published case reports have implied a possible link between use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and NF, though the evidence of the link was said to be weak because of a छोटी number of case patients and it was unclear whether the drugs just masked the symptoms of a secondary infection or were a cause per se.

The Earth Day Flag, the latest proposal of John McConnell for a flag of धरती Day
Earth Day is an annual event, celebrated on अप्रैल 22, on which events are held worldwide to demonstrate support for environmental सुरक्षा.
It was first celebrated in 1970, and is अभी coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network, and मनाये in more than 192 countries each साल.
In 1969 at a UNESCO Conference in San Francisco, the date proposed was March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere.
This day of nature 's equipoise was later sanctioned in a Proclamation signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United राष्ट्र.
A month later a separate Earth Day was founded by United States Senator Gaylord Nelson as an environmental teach-in first held on April 22, 1970.
Nelson was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Award in recognition of his work.
While this April 22 Earth Day was केन्द्रित on the United States, an organization launched by Denis Hayes, who was the original national coordinator in 1970, took it अंतरराष्ट्रीय in 1990 and organized events in 141 nations.

Iodine is a रासायनिक element with symbol i and atomic number 53.
The नाम is from Greek ioeidēs, meaning violet or जामुनी, due to the color of elemental iodine vapor.
Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition, and industrially in the production of acetic acid and certain polymers.
Iodine 's relatively high atomic number, low toxicity, and ease of attachment to organic compounds have made it a part of many X-ray contrast materials in modern medicine.
Iodine has only एक stable isotope.
a number of आयोडीन radioisotopes are भी used in medical applications.
Iodine is found on Earth mainly as the अत्यधिक water-soluble iodide ion, I−, which concentrates it in oceans and brine pools.
Like the other halogens, free iodine occurs मुख्यतः as a diatomic molecule I2, and then only momentarily after being oxidized from आयोडाइड by an oxidant like free oxygen.
In the universe and on Earth, iodine 's high atomic number makes it a relatively rare element.
However, its presence in ocean water has given it a role in biology.
It is the heaviest essential element utilized widely by life in biological functions ( only tungsten, employed in enzymes by a few species of bacteria, is heavier ).
Iodine 's rarity in many soils, due to initial low प्रचुरता as a crust-element, and also leaching of soluble iodide by rainwater, has led to many deficiency problems in land animals and अंतर्देशीय human populations.
Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable कारण of intellectual disabilities.
Iodine is required by higher animals, which उपयोग it to synthesize thyroid hormones, which contain the element.
Because of this function, radioisotopes of iodine are concentrated in the thyroid gland along with nonradioactive iodine.
If inhaled, the radioisotope iodine-131, which has a high fission product yield, concentrates in the thyroid, but is easily remedied with potassium iodide treatment.
Lobbying ( also lobby ) is the act of attempting to influence decisions made by officials in the government, most often legislators or members of regulatory agencies.
Lobbying is done by many different types of people and organized groups, including individuals in the private sector, corporations, fellow legislators or government officials, or advocacy groups ( interest groups ).
Lobbyists may be among a legislator 's constituencies, meaning a voter or bloc of voters भीतर his or her electoral district, or not ; वे may engage in lobbying as a business, or not.
Professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation on behalf of a group or individual who hires them.
Individuals and nonprofit organizations can also lobby as an act of volunteering or as a small part of their normal job ( for उदाहरण, a सीईओ meeting with a representative परिचय a project important to his/her company, or an activist meeting with his/her legislator in an unpaid capacity ).
Governments often define and regulate organized group lobbying that has become influential.
The ethics and morality of lobbying are.
Lobbying is often spoken of with contempt, when the implication is that people with inordinate socioeconomic power are corrupting the law ( twisting it away from fairness ) in order to serve their own विरोध of ब्याज.
But another side of lobbying is making sure that others ' interests are duly defended against others ' corruption, or even simply making sure that minority interests are fairly defended against mere tyranny of the majority.
For example, a medical association, or a trade association of health insurance companies, may lobby a legislature in order to counteract the influence of tobacco companies, in which case the lobbying would be viewed by most people as justified ( duly defending against others ' corruption ).
The परेशानी in drawing objective लाइनों between which lobbyists are `` शुभ lobbyists '' and which ones are `` bad ones '' is compounded by the cleverness with जिससे lobbyists or their clients can argue that their own lobbying is of the `` good '' kind.
At दिल, the effort to influence legislation is a power struggle.
As in other forms of power संघर्ष, such as war or law enforcement, motives range from to self-defense to fighting for justice, and the dividing लकीर between predation and justice is विषय to rationalization.

A league is a unit of length ( or, rarely, area ).
It was long common in Europe and Latin America, but it is no longer an official unit in any nation.
The league originally referred to the distance a person could walk in an hour.
Since the Middle Ages, many values have been specified in several countries.
In the context of nautical distances, the 3 mile ( 4.8 km ) distance corresponds to how far an निरीक्षक of average height ( 5'9 '' or 1.78 m ) can see when standing at समुद्र level.
यूँ, a ship traveling one `` league '' has reached what थी previously the farthest visible distance on the horizon.
The कमी of a ऐतिहासिक and global standard for the सटीक measure of a `` league '' can be accounted for by the variable उन्नयन of the observer ( i.e., sightings from a ship 's deck vs. masthead ).

Race is a classification system used to categorize humans into large and distinct populations or समूह by anatomical, सांस्कृतिक, ethnic, genetic, geographical, historical, linguistic, religious, or social affiliation.
First used to denote national affiliations, the term began to be used to relate to physical traits in the 17th century.
In the जल्दी 20th century the term was often used, in a taxonomic sense, to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype.
While biologists sometimes use the अवधारणा of race to make भेद among fuzzy sets of traits, others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of रेस often is used in a naive or simplistic way, i.e. that among humans, race has no taxonomic significance : सब living humans belong to the same species, Homo sapiens and subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens.
Social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time, involving लोक taxonomies
that define of individuals based on perceived traits.
Scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete, and generally discourage racial स्पष्टीकरण for collective differentiation in दोनो physical and behavioral traits.
Since the second half of the 20th century the associations of race with the ideologies and theories that grew out of the work of 19th-century anthropologists and physiologists has led to the use of the word race itself becoming problematic.
Although still used in general contexts, it is now often replaced by other words which are less ambiguous and emotionally charged, such as populations, people ( s ), ethnic groups or समुदायों depending on context.

In finance, a बंध is an instrument of indebtedness of the bond issuer to the holders.
It is a debt security, under which the issuer owes the धारकों a debt and, depending on the terms of the bond, is obliged to pay उन्हें interest ( the coupon ) or to repay the principal at a later तिथि, termed the परिपक्वता.
Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals ( semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly ).
Very often the bond is negotiable, i.e. the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market.
Thus a bond is a form of loan or IOU : the holder of the bond is the lender ( creditor ), the issuer of the bond is the borrower ( debtor ), and the coupon is the interest.
Bonds provide the borrower साथ external funds to finance long-term investments, or, in the case of सरकारी bonds, to finance current expenditure.
Certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or short term वाणिज्यिक paper हैं considered to be money मार्केट instruments and not bonds : the main difference is in the length of the term of the instrument.

Old Sparky, the electric chair used at Sing Sing prison
Execution by electrocution, usually performed using an electric chair, is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a विशेषकर built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body.
This execution method was created by employees of थामस Edison during the War of Currents, and has been used only in the संयुक्त States and, for a period of several decades, in the Philippines ( its first use there in 1924 under American occupation, last in 1976 ).
Historically, once the condemned person थी attached to the chair, various cycles ( differing in voltage and duration ) of alternating वर्तमान would be passed through the individual 's body, in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs ( including the brain ).
The पहला jolt of इलेक्ट्रिक current was designed to cause immediate unconsciousness and brain death ; the second one was designed to cause fatal damage to the vital organs.
Death was frequently caused by electrical overstimulation of the heart.
Although in the United States the electric chair has become a प्रतीक of the death penalty, its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection, which is widely believed to be a अधिक humane method of execution.
Although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution, today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the कैदी.
As of 2010, electrocution is an optional form of execution in Alabama, Florida, South Carolina and Virginia.
They allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an वैकल्पिक method.
In the states of Kentucky and Tennessee, the इलेक्ट्रिक chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to legislated dates in 1998 ( Kentucky : March 31, 1998 ; टेनेसी : December 31, 1998 ) and who chose electrocution.
In both states, inmates who do not choose electrocution or inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date हैं killed by lethal injection.
The electric कुर्सी is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the राज्य at the time of execution.
It is the एकमात्र method of execution in Vermont, where treason is the only capital crime.
On फ़रवरी 8, 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair थी a `` cruel and unusual punishment '' under the state 's constitution.
This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska, the only बाकी state to retain electrocution as its sole विधि of execution for murder.

Top बाएँ : The Tennessee Valley Authority, part of the New Deal, being signed into law in 1933.
Top right : Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was responsible for initiatives and programs collectively known as the New Deal.
Bottom : A public mural इससे one of the artists employed by the New Deal.
The New Deal was a series of economic programs enacted in the United States between 1933 and 1936.
They involved presidential executive orders or laws passed by Congress during the पहला पद of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The programs were in response to the Great Depression, और focused on what historians call the `` 3 Rs '' : Relief, Recovery, and Reform.
That is Relief for the unemployed and poor ; Recovery of the economy to normal levels ; and Reform of the financial प्रणाली to prevent a repeat depression.
The New Deal उत्पादित a political realignment, making the Democratic पार्टी the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of nine Presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ), with its base in liberal ideas, the white South, traditional Democrats, big city machines, and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities.
The Republicans were विभाजित, with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as an enemy of business and growth, और liberals accepting कुछ of it and promising to make it more कुशल.
the realignment crystallized into the New Deal गठबन्धन that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s, while the opposition Conservative Coalition largely controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963.
By 1936 the term `` liberal '' typically was used for supporters of the New Deal, and `` conservative `` for its opponents.
From 1934 to 1938, Roosevelt was assisted in his endeavours by a “pro-spender” majority in कॉंग्रेस ( drawn from two-party, competitive, non-machine, Progressive, and Left party districts ).
As noted by सिकंदर Hicks, “Roosevelt, backed by rare, non-Southern Democrat majorities — 270 non-Southern Democrat representatives and 71 non-Southern Democrat senators — spelled Second New Deal reform.”
Many historians फर्क between a `` First New Deal '' ( 1933–34 ) and a `` Second New Deal '' ( 1935–38 ), with the second one more liberal and more controversial.
The `` First New Deal '' ( 1933–34 ) dealt with diverse groups, from banking और railroads to industry and farming, all of which demanded help for economic survival.
The Federal आपात Relief Administration, लिये instance, provided $ 500 million for relief operations by states and cities, while the short-lived CWA ( Civil works Administration ) gave localities money to operate make-work projects in 1933-34.
The `` Second New सौदे `` in 1935–38 included the Wagner Act to promote labor unions, the Works Progress प्रशासन ( WPA ) relief program ( which made the federal government by far the largest single employer in the nation ), the Social Security Act, and new programs to aid tenant farmers and migrant मजदूर.
The final major items of New सौदे legislation were the creation of the United राज्य Housing Authority and Farm Security Administration, both in 1937, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which set maximum घंटों and minimum wages for most categories of workers.
The economic downturn of 1937–38, and the bitter split between the AFL and CIO labor संघ led to major Republican gains in Congress in 1938.
Conservative Republicans and Democrats in Congress joined in the informal Conservative Coalition.
By 1942–43 they shut down relief programs such as the WPA और CCC and blocked major liberal proposals.
रूज़वेल्ट himself turned his attention to the war effort, and won reelection in 1940 and 1944.
The Supreme Court declared the नेशनल Recovery Administration ( NRA ) and the first version of the Agricultural Adjustment अधिनियम ( aaa ) unconstitutional, however the AAA was rewritten and तब upheld.
As the first Republican president elected after FDR, Dwight D. Eisenhower ( 1953–61 ) left the New Deal largely intact, even expanding it in some areas.
In the 1960s, Lyndon B. Johnson 's Great Society used the नई Deal as प्रेरणा for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs, which Republican रिचर्ड M. Nixon generally retained.
After 1974, however, the call for deregulation of the economy gained bipartisan support.
The New सौदे regulation of banking ( Glass–Steagall Act ) was suspended in the 1990s.
Many New Deal programs remain active, with some still operating under the original names, सहित the Federal जमा Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation ( FCIC ), the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ), and the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ).

Although not used by the majority of the world 's countries, daylight saving time is common in the Western world.
daylight saving time ( DST ) —also summer time in British English — is the practice of advancing clocks during the lighter months so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less.
Typically clocks हैं adjusted forward one hour निकट the प्रारंभ of spring and are adjusted backward in autumn.
The modern idea of daylight saving was first proposed in 1895 by George vernon Hudson and it was first implemented during the First World War.
Many countries have used it at various times since then.
Much of the United States used DST in the 1950s and 1960s, and dst use expanded following the 1970s energy crisis and has been widely used in North America and Europe since then.
The practice has been both praised and criticized.
Adding daylight to evenings benefits retailing, sports, and अन्य activities that exploit sunlight after working hours, but can cause problems for evening entertainment and other occupations tied to the sun.
Although an early goal of DST was to reduce evening उपयोग of incandescent lighting ( formerly a primary use of electricity ), आधुनिक heating and cooling usage patterns differ greatly, and research about how DST currently affects energy use is limited or contradictory.
DST clock shifts present other चुनौतियां.
They complicate timekeeping, and can disrupt meetings, travel, billing, रिकार्ड keeping, medical devices, heavy equipment, and sleep patterns.
Software can often समायोजन computer clocks automatically, but this can be limited and error-prone, particularly when DST dates are changed.

However, most समकालीन scholars now regard it as the earliest of the canonical gospels ( c 70 ).
That Mark was used as a source for the other synoptic gospels Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke is widely held by many, although not all, नई Testament scholars.

Some of the stories in the gospel may have been transmitted orally before being written down.
Various elements within the इन्जील suggest that the author wrote in Syria or Palestine for a non-Jewish Christian community.

A typical experimental setup for an aldol प्रतिक्रिया.
Both flasks are submerged in a dry ice/acetone cooling bath ( −78 °C ) the temperature of which is being monitored by a thermocouple ( the तार on the left ).
A कूलिंग bath, in प्रयोगशाला chemistry ( often but not always organic chemistry ) practice, is a liquid mixture which is used to maintain low temperatures, typically between 13 °C and −196 °C.
ये low temperatures are used to collect liquids after distillation, to हटाएँ solvents using a rotary evaporator, or to perform a chemical reaction नीचे room temperature ( see : kinetic control ).
Cooling baths are generally एक of two types : ( a ) a cold fluid ( particularly liquid nitrogen, water, or even air ) — but most commonly the term refers to ( b ) a mixture of 3 components : ( 1 ) a cooling agent ( such as dry ice or water ice ) ; ( b ) a द्रव 'carrier ' ( such as liquid water, ethylene glycol, acetone, इत्यादि. ), which transfers heat between the bath and the vessel ; ; and ( c ) an additive to गुमसुम the melting-point of the solid/liquid system.
( A familiar example of this is the use of an ice/rock-salt mixture to freeze ice cream.
The phase-change of बर्फ into liquid water requires energy, 'pulling ' heat from the system.
Adding salt lowers the temp at which this happens, meaning more उर्जा has to be absorbed from the environment in order to melt the बर्फ.
This effectively makes the ice 'colder ' — it must 'pull ' more heat from its environment to become liquid. )
Eating disorders are conditions पारिभाषित by abnormal eating habits that may involve either insufficient or excessive food intake to the detriment of an individual 's physical and mental health.
Bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are the most आम specific forms in the संयुक्त किंगडम.

Bulimia nervosa is a disorder characterized by binge eating and purging.
Purging can include self-induce vomiting, over-exercising, and the usage of diuretics, enemas, and laxatives.
Anorexia nervosa is characterized by extreme food restriction to the point of self-starvation and excessive weight loss.
Though primarily thought of as affecting females ( an estimated 5–10 million being affected in the U.K. ), eating disorders affect males as खूब.
An estimated 10 – 15 % of people with eating disorders are males ( गोर्गान, 1999 ).
( an estimated 1 million U.K. males being affected ).
Although eating विकार are increasing all over the संसार among both men and women, there is evidence to suggest that it is women in the Western संसार who are at the highest risk of developing उन्हें and the degree of westernization increases the risk.
Nearly half of all अमेरिकी personally know someone with an eating disorder.
The skill to comprehend the central processes of appetite has increased tremendously since leptin was discovered, and the skill to observe the functions of the brain as well.
interactions between motivational, homeostatic and self-regulatory control processes are involved in eating behaviour, which is a key component in eating disorders.
the precise cause of eating disorders is not entirely समझा, but वहीँ is evidence that it may be linked to other medical शर्तें and situations.
Cultural idealization of thinness and youthfulness have contributed to eating disorders affecting diverse populations.
One study showed that girls with adhd have a greater chance of getting an eating disorder than those not affected by ADHD.
Another study suggested that women with PTSD, especially due to sexually related trauma, are more likely to develop anorexia nervosa.
एक study showed that foster girls are more संभावित to develop bulimia nervosa.
Some think that peer pressure and idealized body-types seen in the media are also a significant factor.
Some research show that for certain people there are genetic reasons why they may be prone to developing an eating disorder.
Recent studies have found evidence a correlation between patients with bulimia nervosa and substance use disorders.
In addition, anxiety disorders and personality विकार are आम occurrences with क्लाइंट of eating disorders.
While proper treatment can be highly effective for many suffering from specific प्रकार of eating disorders, the consequences of eating disorders can be severe, including मौत ( whether from direct medical effects of disturbed eating habits or from comorbid conditions such as suicidal thinking ).
Slavery in the United States existed from the early years of the colonial काल ; it was firmly established by the time the United States sought independence from Great Britain in 1776.
However, by 1804, all states north of the Mason and Dixon Line had either abolished slavery outright or passed laws for the gradual abolition of slavery.
In 1787 Congress prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory.
But slavery gained new life in the South with the cotton industry after 1800, and expanded into the Southwest.
The nation was polarized into slave और free राज्य along the Mason-Dixon Line, which separated Pennsylvania and Maryland.
The United States and Great Britain both prohibited the international slave व्यापार in 1808, but the domestic trade, साथ sales to the Deep South, expanded dramatically, और many captives were shipped by the coastwise slave trade.
Before the 1840s, the South was vigorously defending slavery and its expansion into the territories.
In the North some abolitionists denounced it as sinful, and numerous anti-slavery forces अस्वीकृत it as detrimental to the rights of free men.
After failed compromises and Abraham Lincoln 's election, in 1861 eleven slave states broke away to form the Confederate States of America, अग्रणी to the American Civil War.

In the 17th century, Virginia, followed by other southern colonies, enacted law that children of slave mothers were born into slavery.
Slaves could लाभ freedom only by running away ( which थी difficult and illegal to do ), or by manumission by owners, which थी regulated by states, and became increasingly difficult or prohibited.
In the earliest era of chattel slavery, the colonies also organized work by a system of bonded labor known as indentured servitude.
This typically lasted for several years लिये both poor Europeans and Africans alike, to pay off the costs of transport to the colonies.
They contracted for such arrangements because of poor economies in their home countries.
Between 1680 और 1700, as fewer Europeans migrated to the colonies, planters began to import more Africans as slaves.
Recognizing the महत्व of slavery, the House of Burgesses in Virginia enacted a new slave code in 1705 ; it combined a variety of legislation and added नई provisions enforcing white supremacy in the law.

This clock representation shows some of the major units of geological time and definitive events of Earth history.
The Hadean eon represents the time before fossil रिकार्ड of life on Earth ; its upper boundary is अभी regarded as 4.0 Ga ( billion years पहले ).
Other subdivisions प्रतिबिंबित the evolution of life ; the archean and Proterozoic are both eons, the Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic हैं eras of the Phanerozoic इओन.
The two million year Quaternary period, the time of recognizable humans, is too small to be visible at this scale.
the भूगर्भिक time scale is a system of chronological measurement कि relates stratigraphy to time, and is used by geologists, paleontologists, and other धरती scientists to describe the timing and relationships between events that have occurred throughout Earth 's history.
The table of geologic time spans presented here agrees with the dates and nomenclature set forth by the International Commission on Stratigraphy standard color codes of the International आयोग on स्तरिकी.
Evidence from radiometric dating indicates that the Earth is about 4.54 billion years old.
The geology or deep time of Earth 's past has been organized into various units according to events which took place in each period.
Different spans of time on the GTS are usually delimited by changes in the composition of strata which correspond to them, indicating major geological or paleontological events, ऐसे as mass extinctions.
For example, the boundary between the Cretaceous period and the Paleogene period is defined by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which marked the demise of the dinosaurs और many other groups of जीवन.
Older time spans which predate the विश्वसनीय fossil रिकार्ड ( before the Proterozoic Eon ) हैं defined by absolute age.

Biological classification, or scientific classification in biology, is a method of scientific taxonomy used to group and categorize जीवों into groups such as genus or species.
ये groups are known as taxa ( singular : टैक्सोन ).
Modern biological classification has its root in the work of Carolus Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics.
These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the Darwinian principle of common descent.
With the परिचय of the cladistic विधि in the late 20th century, phylogenetic taxonomy in which organisms are grouped based purely on inferred evolutionary relatedness, ignoring morphological similarity, has become common in some areas of biology.

When officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854, abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine if Kansas would become a free राज्य or a slave state.
Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as Bleeding Kansas.

Today, Kansas is one of the most productive agricultural राज्य, producing high yields of wheat, sorghum and sunflowers.
Kansas is the 15th most extensive and the 33rd most populous of the 50 United States.
मनोविज्ञान is an academic and applied discipline that involves the scientific study of mental functions and behaviors.
Psychology has the immediate goal of understanding individuals and groups by both establishing general principles and researching specific cases, and by many accounts it ultimately aims to लाभ society.
In this field, a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a सोशल, behavioral, or cognitive scientist.
Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and सोशल behavior, while also exploring the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie certain cognitive functions and behaviors.
Psychologists explore concepts such as perception, cognition, attention, emotion, phenomenology, motivation, brain कामकाज, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships.
Psychologists of diverse stripes also consider the unconscious mind.
Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables.
In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, some—especially clinical and counseling psychologists—at times rely upon symbolic interpretation and अन्य inductive techniques.
Psychology has been described as a `` hub science '', with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, and the humanities, such as philosophy.
While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also निर्देशित towards understanding और solving problems in अनेक different spheres of human activity.
The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings.
Many do scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior, and typically work in university psychology departments or teach in other academic settings ( e.g., medical schools, hospitals ).
Some are employed in industrial and organizational settings, or in अन्य areas such as इंसान development and aging, खेल, health, and the media, as well as in forensic investigation and other aspects of law.

Accuracy indicates proximity of measurement results to the true value, precision to the repeatability, or reproducibility of the measurement
In the fields of science, engineering, industry, and statistics, the accuracy of a measurement प्रणाली is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to कि quantity 's वास्तविक ( true ) value.
the precision of a measurement system, also called reproducibility or repeatability, is the degree to which repeated माप under unchanged conditions show the वही results.
हालांकि the two words reproducibility and repeatability can be synonymous in colloquial use, वे हैं deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.
A measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, neither, or both.
For उदाहरण, if an experiment contains a systematic error, then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy.
The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment.
Eliminating the व्यवस्थित error improves accuracy but does not change precision.
A measurement system is designated valid if it is दोनो accurate and precise.
Related terms include bias ( non- random or निर्देशित effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable ) and error ( random variability ).
The terminology is also applied to indirect measurements—that is, values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data.
In addition to accuracy और precision, measurements may also have a measurement resolution, which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a जवाब in the measurement.
In the case of full reproducibility, such as when rounding a number to a representable floating point number, the word precision has a meaning not सम्बन्धित to reproducibility.
For example, in the IEEE 754-2008 standard it means the number of bits in the significand, so it is used as a माप for the relative accuracy with which an arbitrary number can be represented.

Community property is a marital property regime that originated in civil law jurisdictions and is now also मिला in some common law jurisdictions.
The states of the United राज्य कि recognize community property are primarily in the West ; it थी inherited from Mexico 's ganancial community system, which itself was inherited from Spanish law ( a Roman -derived civil law प्रणाली ) और ultimately from the Visigoths.
While under Spanish rule Louisiana अपनाया the ganancial community system of acquests and gains, which replaced the traditional French community of movables and acquests in its civil law system.
Map of the United States with community property states highlighted in red.
In addition to the highlighted states, Alaska is a separate property state कि permits couples to opt into a community property arrangement.
In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage ( except for gifts or inheritances ) —the community, or communio bonorum—is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment or death.
Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.
Division of community property may take place by item, by splitting all items or by value.
In some jurisdictions, such as California, a 50/50 division of community property is strictly mandated by statute, meaning that the focus then shifts to whether particular items are to be classified as community or पृथक property.
In अन्य jurisdictions, such as Texas, a divorce अदालत may decree an `` equitable distribution `` of community property, which may result in an unequal division of such.
In non-community property states property may be divided by निष्पक्ष distribution.
Generally speaking, the property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property ( i.e., not community property ).
See प्रभाग of property.
Division of community debts may नहीं be the same as division of community प्रॉपर्टी.
For example, in California, community property is required to be divided `` equally '' while community debt is required to be divided `` equitably ''.
Property that is owned by one spouse before the marriage is the separate property of that spouse, unless the property is `` transmuted '' into community property.
The rules for this vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

A hand ( med. / lat. : manus, pl. manūs ) is a prehensile, multi- fingered extremity स्तिथ at the end of an arm or forelimb of primates and humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs.
A few अन्य vertebrates such as the koala ( which has two opposable thumbs on each `` हाथ '' and फिंगरप्रिंट remarkably similar to human फिंगरप्रिंट ) are often described as having either `` hands '' or `` paws '' on their front limbs.
Hands are the main structures लिये physically manipulating the environment, used for both gross motor skills ( such as grasping a large object ) and fine motor skills ( such as picking up a small pebble ).
The fingertips contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings on the body, are the richest source of tactile feedback, and have the greatest positioning capability of the body ; यूँ the sense of touch is intimately संबद्ध with hands.
Like अन्य paired organs ( eyes, feet, legs ), each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere, so that handedness, or the पसन्दीदा hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning.
Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally — for example, in the context of whether the तीन digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand.
The human hand has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid हड्डियों which number varies between people.
14 of which are the phalanges ( proximal, intermediate and distal ) of the उंगलियाँ.
The metacarpals are the bones that connects the fingers and the wrist.
Each human hand has 5 metacarpals और 8 carpal हड्डियों.

The five sets of the board game Monopoly depicted here show the evolution of the game 's artwork and designs in the United States इससे 1935–2005.
The history of the board game Monopoly can be traced back to the early 20th century.
The earliest known डिज़ाइन was by the American, Elizabeth Magie, patented in 1904 but existing as early as 1902.
magie 's original intent was to publish a board game to illustrate an economic principle, namely the georgist concept of a single land value tax.
A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land.
By 1934, a board game had महरूम created much like the version of Monopoly बेची by Parker Brothers and इसके related companies through the rest of the 20th century, and into the 21st.
Several people, ज़्यादातर in the Midwestern United States और near the East Coast, contributed to the game 's डिज़ाइन and एवोल्यूशन.
By the 1970s, the idea कि the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore ; it was printed in the game 's instructions for many years, in a 1974 book devoted to Monopoly, and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007.
Even a guide to family games published for Reader 's Digest in 2003 only gave credit to Darrow and Elizabeth Magie, erroneously stating कि Magie 's original game was created in the 1800s, and not acknowledging any of the game 's development between Magie 's सृष्टि of the game, and the eventual publication by Parker Brothers.
Also in the 1970s, Professor Ralph Anspach, who had himself published a board game intended to illustrate the सिद्धान्त of both monopolies और trust busting, fought Parker Brothers और its then parent company, General Mills, over the trademarks of the Monopoly board game.
Through the research of anspach and others, much of the early history of the खेल was `` rediscovered ''.
Anspach confronted Maxine Brady, author of the 1974 book The Monopoly Book : Strategy and Tactics of the World 's Most Popular Game over the वास्तविक history of the game on Barry Farber 's New यॉर्क City talk show in 1975.
Because of the lengthy court process, including appeals, the विधिक status of Parker Brothers ' trademarks on the game was not settled until 1985.
The game 's name remains a registered trademark of पार्कर Brothers, as do its specific design elements.
At the निष्कर्ष of the court case, the game 's logo and graphic design elements became part of a larger Monopoly brand, licensed by Parker Brothers ' parent companies onto a variety of items through the present day.
Despite the `` rediscovery '' of the board game 's early history in the 1970s and 1980s, and several books and journal articles on the subject, Hasbro ( Parker Brothers ' current parent company ) did not acknowledge any of the game 's history पहले Charles Darrow on its official Monopoly website as recently as June 2012.
Nor किया Hasbro acknowledge anyone other than Darrow in materials published or sponsored by them, at least as recently as 2006.
International tournaments, first held in the early 1970s, continue to the उपस्थित, with the अगला world championship likely scheduled for 2013.
Starting in 1985, a new generation of spin-off board games and card games appeared on दोनो पहलू of the Atlantic Ocean.
In 1989, the first of many video game and computer game editions was published.
Since 1994, many official variants of the game, based on locations other than Atlantic City, New Jersey ( the आधिकारिक U.S. setting ) or London ( the official Commonwealth setting, excepting Canada ), have महरूम published by Hasbro or its licensees.
In 2008, Hasbro permanently changed the color scheme and some of the gameplay of the standard U.S. Edition of the game to मैच the UK Edition, although the U.S. standard edition maintains the Atlantic City property names.
Hasbro also modified the official logo to दे the `` mr. Monopoly '' अक्षर a 3-D computer-generated look, which has since been adopted by licensees USAopoly, Winning Moves and Winning समाधान.
And Hasbro has also been including the गति Die, introduced in 2006 's Monopoly : The Mega Edition by Winning Moves Games, in versions produced directly by Hasbro ( such as the 2009 Championship Edition ).

World population estimates from 1800 to 2100, based on UN 2010 projections ( red, orange, green ) and US Census ब्यूरो historical estimates ( black ).
Actual recorded population figures are in blue.
According to the highest estimate, the world population may rise to 16 billion by 2100 ; according to the lowest estimate, it may decline to 6 billion.
The संसार population is the total number of living humans on Earth.
As of today, it is estimated to number billion by the United States जनसांख्यिकी Bureau ( uscb ).
The USCB estimates that the world population exceeded 7 billion on March 12, 2012.
According to a separate estimate by the United राष्ट्र जनसांख्यिकी Fund, it पहुँचे this milestone on October 31, 2011.
The world जनसांख्यिकी has experienced continuous growth since the end of the Great Famine and the Black Death in 1350, जब it stood at around 370 million.
The highest rates of growth – global population increases above 1.8 % per साल – were seen briefly during the 1950s, and for a longer period during the 1960s and 1970s.
the growth rate peaked at 2.2 % in 1963, and had declined to 1.1 % by 2011.

Knuckle mnemonic for the number of days in each month of the Gregorian Calendar.
Each projecting knuckle represents a 31-day month.
A mnemonic (, with a silent `` m '' ), or mnemonic device, is any learning technique that aids information retention.
Mnemonics aim to अनुवाद information into a form that the human brain can retain better than इसके original form.
Even the process of applying इस परिवर्तन might already aid the transfer of information to long-term memory.
Commonly encountered mnemonics हैं often for lists and in auditory form, such as short poems, acronyms, or memorable phrases, but mnemonics can also be for other types of information and in visual or kinesthetic forms.
Their use is based on the observation that the human mind more easily remembers spatial, personal, surprising, physical, sexual, humorous, or otherwise 'relatable ' information, बल्कि than more abstract or impersonal forms of information.
the word mnemonic is derived from the Ancient यूनानी word μνημονικός ( mnēmonikos ), meaning `` of memory '' और is related to Mnemosyne ( `` remembrance '' ), the name of the goddess of memory in Greek mythology.
Both of these words हैं derived from μνήμη ( mnēmē ), `` remembrance, memory ''.
mnemonics in antiquity were most often माना in the context of what is today known as the Art of memory.
Ancient Greeks and Romans distinguished between two types of memory : the 'natural ' memory and the 'artificial ' memory.
The former is inborn, and is the one that everyone uses automatically and without सोच.
The artificial memory in contrast has to be trained and developed through the learning and practicing of a variety of mnemonic techniques.
Mnemonic systems are special techniques or strategies consciously used to improve memory, it helps employ information already stored in long-term memory to make memorization an easier task.

This 15th-century depiction of Charlemagne and Pope Adrian i shows a well-bred medieval horse with arched neck, परिष्कृत head and elegant gait.
Horses in the Middle Ages differed in आकार, build and नस्ल from the modern horse, and were, on average, छोटी.
They were also more central to society than their modern counterparts, being essential for war, agriculture, and transport.
Consequently, विशिष्ट types of horse विकसित, many of which have no modern समतुल्य.
While an understanding of modern horse breeds and equestrianism is vital for any analysis of the medieval horse, researchers also need to consider documentary ( both written and pictorial ) and archaeological evidence.
Horses in the Middle Ages were rarely differentiated by breed, but बल्कि by use.
This led उन्हें to be described, for उदाहरण, as `` chargers `` ( युद्ध horses ), `` palfreys `` ( riding horses ), cart घोड़े or packhorses.
Reference is also given to their place of origin, such as `` Spanish horses, '' but whether this referred to एक breed or several is अनजान.
Another difficulty arising during any study of मध्यकालीन documents or literature is the flexibility of the medieval languages, where several words can be used for one thing ( or, conversely, several वस्तुएँ are referred to by one word ).
Words such as ' courser ' and 'charger ' are used interchangeably ( even within one document ), and जहाँ one epic may speak disparagingly of a rouncey, another गुणगान its कौशल and swiftness.
Significant technological advances in equestrian equipment, प्रायः introduced from other cultures, allowed for significant changes in both warfare and agriculture.
In particular, improved designs for the solid-treed saddle as well as the arrival of the stirrup, horseshoe and horse collar were significant advances in medieval society.
Consequently, the assumptions and theories developed by historians are not definitive, and बहस still rages on many issues, ऐसे as the breeding or size of the घोड़ा, and a number of sources must be consulted in order to understand the breadth of the subject.

A desert is a landscape or region of land that is very dry because of low rainfall amounts ( precipitation ), प्रायः has little coverage by plants, and in which streams dry up unless they are supplied by water from outside areas.
Deserts can also be described as areas where more water is lost by evapotranspiration than falls as precipitation.
Desert plants जरूर have special adaptations to survive with this little water.
Deserts generally receive less than 25 cm of rain ( precipitation ) each year.

These alliances यहूद both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy, Japan and the United States joined the Allies, and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers.
Ultimately, more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history.
अधिक than 9 million combatants were मारे, largely because of technological advancements that led to विशाल increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility.

After the German march on Paris थी brought to a halt—the so-called Miracle of the marne —the Western Front settled into a static battle of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917.
On the Eastern Front, the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians, but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the Germans.
in November the Ottoman Empire joined the war, खोलने up fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia और the Sinai.
Italy and Bulgaria went to war in 1915 and Romania in 1916.
In Russia, the tsar 's government collapsed in March 1917 and a subsequent revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers.
After a 1918 German offensive along the western front, the Allies drove वापस the germans in a series of successful offensives and American forces began entering the trenches.
Germany, जिससे had its own trouble with revolutionaries, agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918.
The war ended in विजय for the Allies.
कार्यक्रम on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts, as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and आर्थिक resources to fight a total war.
By the end of the war, four प्रमुख imperial powers—the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires—ceased to exist.
The successor states of the पूर्व two lost a great amount of territory, while the latter two were dismantled entirely.
The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states.
The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict.

Historia
by Nikolaos Gysis ( 1892 )
History ( from Greek - historia, meaning `` inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation '' ) is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about these events.
The term includes cosmic, geologic, and organic history, लकिन is प्रायः generically implied to mean human history.
Scholars who write about history are called इतिहासकारों.
History can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them.
Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing `` perspective '' on the problems of the present.
Stories common to a particular culture, लकिन not supported by external sources ( such as the tales surrounding King Arthur ) are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends, because they do not support the `` disinterested छानबीन '' required of the discipline of history.
कार्यक्रम occurring prior to written record are considered प्रागितिहास.
Herodotus, a 5th सदी B.C. Greek historian is considered within the Western tradition to be the `` father of history '', and, along with his contemporary Thucydides, helped form the foundations for the modern study of इंसान history.
उनके work continues to be read today and the divide between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing.
In the Eastern tradition, a state chronicle the Spring and Autumn Annals was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BCE although only 2nd century bce texts survived.
Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history जिससे have evolved over the सदियां and continue to change today.

Detractors accused him of preaching racism, ब्लैक supremacy, and violence.
He has been called one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history.
Malcolm X 's father died—killed by white supremacists, it was rumored—when he was young, and at least one of his uncles was lynched.
When he was 13, his माँ was placed in a mental hospital, and he was placed in a series of foster homes.
In 1946, at age 20, he went to थाना for तोड़कर and प्रवेश.
In prison, Malcolm X became a सदस्य of the Nation of Islam ; after his parole in 1952, he quickly rose to become one of its leaders.
लिये a dozen years, Malcolm X was the public face of the controversial समूह, but disillusionment with Nation of Islam head इलियास Muhammad led him to leave the Nation in March 1964.
After a काल of travel in Africa and the Middle ईस्ट, he लौटे to the United States, where he founded Muslim Mosque, Inc. और the Organization of Afro-American Unity.
In February 1965, less than a year after leaving the Nation of islam, he was assassinated by three members of the group.

Spiders ( order Araneae ) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom.
They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other groups of organisms.
Spiders are मिला worldwide on every continent except लिये Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exception of air and sea colonization.
As of 2008, at least 43,678 spider species, और 109 families have been recorded by taxonomists ; however, there रै been confusion within the वैज्ञानिक community as to how all these families should be classified, as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900.
anatomically, spiders differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel.
Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae.
In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia हैं fused into one mass in the cephalothorax.
Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend उन्हें by hydraulic pressure.
Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six प्रकार of silk ग्रंथियों भीतर their abdomen.
Spider webs vary widely in size, shape and the amount of sticky thread used.
It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms, and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-web spiders.
Spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about, but ये animals जाहिर lacked spinnerets.
True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks इससे, and are very similar to the सबसे primitive surviving order, the Mesothelae.
The main समूह of आधुनिक spiders, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae, first appeared in the Triassic period, before.
A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was described in 2008, but all other known species are predators, ज़्यादातर preying on insects and on other मकड़ियों, हालांकि a few large species also take birds and lizards.
Spiders use a wide range of strategies to capture prey : trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down.
Most detect prey mainly by संवेदन vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, और hunters of the genus portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones.
Spiders ' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they liquidize their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes और grinding it with the bases of their pedipalps, as they do not have true jaws.
Male spiders identify themselves by a variety of complex courtship संस्कार to avoid being eaten by the females.
Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short life spans.
Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs.

RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North अटलांटिक Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from southampton, UK to New York City, us.
The sinking of Titanic caused the deaths of 1,502 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.
The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of her maiden voyage.
She थी the second of three Olympic class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line, and वो was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast with Thomas एंड्रयूज, who perished with the ship, as her naval architect.
On उसके maiden voyage, वो carried 2,224 passengers and क्रू.
Under the command of Edward Smith, her passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as सैंकड़ों of emigrants इससे Great Britain and आयरलैंड, Scandinavia और elsewhere throughout Europe seeking a new life in North America.
the जलयान was designed to be the last word in comfort and luxury, with an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins.
She also had a powerful बेतार telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use.
Though she had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, she lacked enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard.
Because of outdated maritime safety regulations, she carried तभी enough lifeboats for 1,178 people—slightly more than half of the number यात्राएं on the maiden voyage, and one-third her total passenger and crew capacity.
After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in फ़्रांस and Queenstown ( now Cobh ) in Ireland before heading westwards towards New यॉर्क.
On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing and परिचय 375 miles ( 600 km ) south of न्यूफ़ाउंडलैंड, she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm ship 's time.
The glancing collision caused Titanics hull plates to buckle inwards साथ her starboard side and opened five of her सोलह watertight compartments to the sea ; the ship धीरे filled with water.
Meanwhile, passengers और some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched तभी partly loaded.
a disproportionate number of men were left सवार because of a `` women and children पहला `` protocol followed by some of the officers loading the lifeboats.

बस under two hours after the Titanic foundered, the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene of the sinking, where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.
The disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and आक्रोश at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures कि had led to it.
Public inquiries in Britain and the United राज्य led to major improvements in maritime safety.
One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ( SOLAS ), which still governs maritime सुरक्षा today.
Additionally, अनेक new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications -- -which could have saved many more passengers.

James Madison, Jr. ( कूच 16, 1751 ( O.S. March 5 ) – June 28, 1836 ) was an American statesman and political theorist, the चौथी President of the United States ( 1809–1817 ).
He is hailed as the “Father of the Constitution” for being instrumental in the drafting of the United States Constitution and as the कुंजी champion and author of the United States Bill of अधिकारों.
He served as a politician much of his वयस्क life.
After the constitution had been drafted, Madison became one of the leaders in the movement to ratify it.
His collaboration with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay produced the Federalist Papers ( 1788 ).
Circulated only in New York at the समय, they would later be considered among the most important polemics in support of the Constitution.
He was also a delegate to the Virginia constitutional ratifying convention, और was instrumental to the successful अनुसमर्थन effort in Virginia.
Like most of his contemporaries, Madison changed his political views during his life.
During the drafting and अनुसमर्थन of the constitution, he favored a strong national government, though later he grew to favor stronger state governments, before settling between the two extremes late in his life.
In 1789, Madison became a leader in the new House of Representatives, drafting many basic laws.
He is notable for drafting the first टेन amendments to the Constitution, and यूँ is known as the `` Father of the Bill of Rights ``.
Madison worked closely with President George Washington to organize the new federal government.

The American middle class is a social class in the United States.
While the अवधारणा is typically ambiguous in popular opinion and common भाषा use, contemporary social scientists have put forward several, more or कम congruent, theories on the American middle class.
Depending on class model प्रयुक्त, the middle class may constitute anywhere from 25 % to 66 % of households.
One of the first major studies of the मध्य class in America was White Collar : The American Middle Classes, published in 1951 by sociologist C. Wright Wright_Mills Mills Wright_Mills.
Later sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert of Hamilton College commonly divide the middle class into two sub-groups.
Constituting roughly 15 % to 20 % of households is the upper or professional middle class consisting of highly educated, salaried professionals और managers.
Constituting roughly one third of households is the lower middle class consisting mostly of semi-professionals, skilled craftsmen and lower-level management.
Middle-class persons commonly have a comfortable मानक of living, significant economic security, considerable work autonomy and rely on their expertise to sustain themselves.
Members of the middle class belong to विविध groups which overlap with each अन्य.
Overall, middle-class व्यक्तियों, especially upper-middle-class individuals, हैं characterized by conceptualizing, creating and consulting.
Thus, college education is one of the main indicators of middle-class status.
Largely attributed to the nature of middle-class occupations, middle class values tend to emphasize independence, adherence to intrinsic standards, valuing नवीनता and respecting non-conformity.
Politically more active than other demographics, college educated मध्य class professionals are split between the दो major parties.
Income varies considerably from near the national median to well in excess of $ 100,000.
Household income figures, however, do not always reflect class status and standard of living, as they are largely influenced by the number of income earners and fail to recognize household size.
It is therefore possible for a large, dual-earner, lower middle class household to out-earn a small, one-earner, upper middle class household.
The middle classes are very influential, as they encompass the majority of voters, writers, teachers, journalists, and editors.
Most societal trends in the US originate within the middle वर्ग.

तबाह from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, remembered as one of the worst natural disasters in United States history
A disaster is a natural or man-made ( or technological ) hazard resulting in an event of substantial extent causing significant physical damage or destruction, loss of life, or drastic change to the environment.
A disaster can be ostensively defined as any tragic event stemming from events such as earthquakes, floods, catastrophic accidents, fires, or विस्फोट.
It is a phenomenon that can cause damage to life और प्रॉपर्टी and नष्ट the economic, social और cultural life of लोगों.
In contemporary academia, disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately managed risk.
These risks are the product of a combination of both hazard/s and vulnerability.
Hazards that strike in areas साथ low vulnerability will never become disasters, as is the मामला in uninhabited regions.
Developing देशों suffer the greatest costs when a विपत्ति hits – more than 95 percent of all मौतों caused by disasters occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural disasters are 20 times greater ( as a प्रतिशत of GDP ) in developing countries than in industrialized countries.
in computing, booting ( also known as booting up ) is the आरंभिक set of operations that a computer system performs when electrical power to the CPU is switched on.
The process begins when a computer is turned on for the first time or is re-energized after being turned बंद, and ends जब the computer is ready to perform its normal operations.
On आधुनिक general purpose computers, this can take tens of seconds and typically involves performing a power-on self-test, locating and initializing peripheral devices, and then finding, loading and starting an operating system.
Many computer systems भी allow these परिचालन to be initiated by a software command without cycling power, in what is known as a soft reboot, though कुछ of the initial operations might be छोड़ा on a soft reboot.
A boot loader is a computer program that loads the main operating system or runtime environment for the computer after completion of the self-tests.
The computer term boot is short for bootstrap or bootstrap load and derives from the phrase to pull oneself up by एक 's bootstraps.
The usage calls attention to the requirement that, if most software is loaded onto a computer by other software already running on the computer, some mechanism must exist to load initial software onto the computer.
Early computers used a variety of ad-hoc methods to get a small program into memory to solve this problem.
The invention of integrated circuit read-only memory ( ROM ) of various types solved this paradox by allowing कंप्यूटर to be shipped with a start up program that could not be erased.
Growth in the capacity of ROM has allowed कभी more elaborate start up procedures to be implemented.
On general purpose कंप्यूटर, the बूट process begins with the execution of an initial program stored in boot ROMs or read in another fashion.
In some older computers, the initial program might have been the application to run, if no operating system was used, or the operating system.
In अन्य computers, the initial program is a boot loader that may then load into random-access memory ( RAM ), from nonvolatile secondary storage ( such as a hard disk drive ) or, in some older computers, from a medium such as punched cards, punched tape, or magnetic tape in older computers, the binary code of an operating system or runtime environment and then चलाएँ it.
if the boot loader is सीमित in its size and capabilities, it may, instead, लोड a larger and more capable secondary boot loader, which would then load the operating system or runtime environment.
Some embedded systems do not require a noticeable boot sequence to शुरू कामकाज and when turned on may simply run operational programs that are stored in rom.

the database forked from borland 's open source edition of InterBase in 2000, but since Firebird 1.5 the code has been largely rewritten.
Outsourcing is the contracting out of an internal business process to a third-party organization.
The अभ्यास of contracting a business process out to a third party rather than स्टॉफ it internally is common in the modern economy.
The term `` outsourcing '' became popular in the United States near the turn of the 21st century.
Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one कड़ to another, but not always.
the definition of outsourcing includes दोनो foreign and domestic contracting, and sometimes includes offshoring, which अर्थात् relocating a business function to another country.
Financial savings from lower international labor rates is a big motivation for outsourcing/offshoring.
The opposite of outsourcing is called insourcing, जिससे entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house, और is sometimes accomplished via vertical integration.
However, a business can provide a contract service to another business बगैर necessarily insourcing that business process.
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is a lentivirus ( धीरे replicating retrovirus ) that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ), a कंडीशन in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive.
संक्रमण with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, semen, vaginal fluid, pre-ejaculate, or breast milk.
Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.
HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells ( specifically CD4 + t cells ), macrophages, and dendritic कोशिकाएं.
HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms including : apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes कि recognize infected cells.
When CD4+ T कोशिका numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections.
The firepole in a fire station in Toronto
A fireman 's pole ( also called a sliding pole or firepole ) is a wooden pole or a मेटल tube or pipe installed between floors in fire stations, allowing firefighters responding to an alarm to quickly descend to the ground floor faster than by using a standard staircase.

Written Simlish
Simlish is a fictional language featured in ea खेल ' Sim series of games.
It debuted in SimCopter, और has been especially prominent in The Sims, The Sims 2 and The सीम 3.
The Sims development team created the unique simlish language by experimenting with fractured Ukrainian, French, Latin, Finnish, English, Fijian, Cebuano, and Tagalog.
Simlish can also be heard in SimCity 4, SimCity Societies and SimCity 2013, but far less frequently.
Civilized Creatures in Spore can also be taught to speak Simlish.
It is also featured to an extent in Firaxis Games ' Sid Meier 's SimGolf.
Designer Will राइट was conscious of the need for dialogue in the game, but thought that using a real भाषा would make it sound too repetitive and would also be too costly to hire अनुवादक for world languages.
Initially, प्रेरित by the Native American code talkers of संसार War II, Sims creator Will Wright and language expert Marc Gimbel suggested experimenting with the Navajo language to create Simlish.
however, they ultimately decided that Simlish worked best as a `` language '' made up of gibberish words that could n't be translated, so that its अर्थ होता be left खोलें to the imagination of the player.
Wright later commented that using `` nonsense language '' turned out to be the सही development choice, as people यहूद capable of imagining it more realistically than a computer could सिमुलेट a real one.
The actual sound of Simlish was created improvisationally by voice actors Stephen Kearin और Gerri Lawlor.
An उदाहरण of Ultrasonic Testing ( ut ) on ब्लेड roots of a V2500 IAE aircraft engine.
Step 1 : The UT probe is placed on the root of the blades to be inspected with the सहायता of a special borescope tool ( video probe ).
Step 2 : Instrument settings are input.
Step 3 : the probe is scanned over the blade root.
In this case, an indication ( peak in the data ) through the red line ( or gate ) indicates a good blade ; an indication to the left of कि range indicates a crack.
Principle of ultrasonic testing.
बाएँ : A probe sends a sound वेव into a test material.
There are two indications, one from the initial pulse of the probe, and the second due to the back wall echo.
RIGHT : A defect creates a third indication and simultaneously reduces the आयाम of the back wall indication.
The depth of the defect is determined by the ratio D/E
In ultrasonic testing ( UT ), very short ultrasonic pulse-waves with center frequencies ranging from 0.1-15 MHz and occasionally up to 50 MHz are launched into materials to detect internal flaws or to characterize materials.
a common example is ultrasonic thickness measurement, which tests the thickness of the test object, लिये example, to monitor pipework corrosion.
Ultrasonic testing is often performed on steel and other metals and alloys, though it can also be used on कंक्रीट, wood and composites, albeit with less resolution.
It is a रूप of non-destructive परीक्षण used in many उद्योग including aerospace, automotive and other transportation sectors.
The vas deferens ( बहुवचन : vasa deferentia ), भी called ductus deferens ( Latin : `` carrying-away vessel '' ; plural : ductus deferentes ), is part of the male anatomy of many vertebrates ; they transport sperm from the epididymis in anticipation of ejaculation.
Vascular ischemia of the toes with characteristic cyanosis.
In medicine, ischemia, also spelled as ischaemia or ischæmia, ( ; from Greek language ισχαιμία, ischaimía ; isch- root denoting a restriction or thinning or to make or grow thin/lean, haema blood ) is a restriction in blood supply to tissues, causing a shortage of oxygen and glucose needed for सेल्यूलर चयापचय ( to keep tissue alive ).

Down सिंड्रोम ( DS ) or Down 's syndrome, also ज्ञात as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.
Down syndrome is the सबसे common chromosome abnormality in humans.
It is typically associated with a delay in cognitive ability ( दिमागी retardation, or MR ) and physical growth, और a particular set of facial characteristics.
The औसत IQ of young adults साथ Down syndrome is around 50, whereas young adults without the condition typically have an IQ of 100.
( MR has historically been defined as an IQ below 70. )
A large proportion of individuals with Down syndrome have a कठोर degree of intellectual disability.
Down syndrome is named after John Langdon bas, the British physician who described the syndrome in 1866.
The condition was clinically described earlier by Jean Etienne Dominique Esquirol in 1838 and Edouard Seguin in 1844.
Down syndrome was identified as a chromosome 21 trisomy by Dr. Jérôme lejeune in 1959.
Down syndrome can be identified in a baby at birth or पहले birth by prenatal screening.
Pregnancies with this diagnosis are often terminated.
The CDC estimates that about one of every 691 babies born in the United States each year is born with Down syndrome.
Many children with Down syndrome are educated in regular school classes while others require specialised educational facilities.
Some children graduate from high school, and, in the US, there are increasing opportunities for participating in post-secondary education.
Education and proper care has महरूम shown to improve quality of life significantly.

The United States presidency of Ronald Reagan, also known as the Reagan administration, थी a रिपब्लिकन administration headed by रोनाल्ड Reagan from January 20, 1981, to January 20, 1989.
Domestically, the administration favored reducing government programs और introduced the largest across-the-board tax cuts in American history.
The economic policies enacted in 1981, known as `` Reaganomics ``, were an example of supply-side अर्थशास्त्र.
Reagan aimed to encourage entrepreneurship and सीमा the growth of social spending, as well as the कटौती of regulation and inflation.
Economic growth saw a strong recovery in the 1980s, helping Reagan to win a landslide re-election.
The national debt increased significantly, however.
Regarding foreign policy, the administration was steadfastly anti-communist, calling the Soviet Union an `` evil empire `` and ending 1970s détente.
Reagan accelerated the massive buildup of the military started by his predecessor, including an invasion of Grenada, the first major विदेशी action by U.S. troops since the end of the Vietnam War.
The `` Reagan Doctrine `` controversially granted aid to paramilitary forces seeking to overthrow कम्युनिस्ट सरकारें, particularly in war-torn Central America and Afghanistan.

Crude death rate by country ( 2006 ).
Mortality rate is a measure of the number of deaths ( in general, or due to a specific cause ) in a population.
Scaled to the size of that population, per ईकाई of time.
Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1000 individuals प्रति year ; यूँ, a mortality rate of 9.5 ( out of 1000 ) in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0.95 % out of the total.
It is पृथक from morbidity rate, which refers to the number of individuals in poor health during a given समय period ( the prevalence rate ) or the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time ( incidence rate ).
The term `` mortality `` is also sometimes inappropriately used to refer to the number of deaths among a set of diagnosed hospital cases for a disease or injury, rather than for the general जनसांख्यिकी of a country or ethnic group.
This disease mortality statistic is more precisely referred to as `` case fatality rate `` ( CFR ).
One distinguishes:
The crude death rate, the total number of मौतों per year per 1000 people.
the crude death rate for the whole world is about 8.37 प्रति 1000 per year according to the current CIA World Factbook.
The perinatal mortality rate, the sum of neonatal deaths and fetal deaths ( stillbirths ) per 1000 births.
the maternal mortality अनुपात, the number of maternal deaths प्रति 100,000 live births in same time period.
the maternal mortality rate, the number of maternal deaths per 1,000 women of reproductive age in the population ( generally पारिभाषित as 15–44 years of age ).
The शिशु मृत्यु rate, the number of मौतों of children less than 1 year बूढ़ा per 1000 सजीव births.
The child mortality rate, the number of deaths of children less than 5 years बूढ़ा per 1000 live births.
The standardised mortality ratio ( SMR ) - This represents a proportional comparison to the numbers of deaths that would have been expected if the population had been of a मानक composition in terms of age, gender, etc.
The age-specific mortality rate ( ASMR ) - This refers to the total क्रमांक of मौतों per year per 1000 people of a given age ( e.g. age 62 last जन्मदिवस ).
In regard to the or failure of medical treatment or procedures, one होता also distinguish:
The early mortality रेट, the कुल number of deaths in the early stages of an ongoing treatment, or in the काल immediately following an उपचार.
The लेट mortality rate, the total number of deaths in the late stages of an ongoing treatment, or a significant length of time after an acute treatment.
Note that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression.
The crude death rate depends on the age ( and gender ) specific mortality rates and the age ( and gender ) वितरण of the population.
the number of deaths per 1000 people can be उच्चतर for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite life expectancy being higher in developed countries due to standards of health being better.
This happens because developed countries typically have a completely different population age distribution, with a much higher proportion of older people, due to both lower recent birth rates and lower mortality rates.
A अधिक complete picture of मृत्यु is given by a life table which shows the mortality rate separately for each age.
A life table is necessary to दे a good अनुमान of life expectancy.

Studies have shown that OAEs गायब after the inner कान रै been damaged, so OAEs are often used in the laboratory and the clinic as a measure of भीतरी ear health.
Broadly speaking, there are two types of otoacoustic emissions : spontaneous otoacoustic emissions ( SOAEs ), which can occur without external stimulation, and evoked otoacoustic emissions ( eoaes ), which require an evoking stimulus.

While there is little consensus on the precise characteristics, scope, and importance of postmodern literature, as is often the case with artistic movements, postmodern literature is commonly defined in relation to a precursor.
For example, a postmodern literary work tends not to conclude with the neatly tied-up ending as is often found in modernist literature, but often parodies it.
Postmodern authors tend to celebrate chance over craft, और further employ metafiction to undermine the लेखक 's authority.
Another characteristic of postmodern literature is the questioning of distinctions between high and low संस्कृति through the use of pastiche, the combination of subjects and genres not previously deemed fit for literature.

A small submersible AC sump pump साथ a garden hose कनेक्टर
A sump pump is a पंप used to remove water that has accumulated in a water collecting sump basin, commonly found in the basement of homes.
The water may डालें via the perimeter drains of a basement waterproofing system, funneling into the basin or because of rain or natural ground water, if the basement is below the water table level.
Sump pumps are used where basement flooding happens regularly and to remedy dampness where the water table is above the foundation of a home.
Sump pumps send water away from a house to any place जहाँ it is no longer problematic, such as a municipal storm drain or a dry well.
Pumps may discharge to the sanitary sewer in older installations.
Once considered acceptable, this practice may now violate the plumbing code or municipal bylaws, because it can overwhelm the municipal sewage treatment system.
Municipalities urge homeowners to disconnect और reroute sump pump discharge away from sanitary sewers.
जुर्माना may be imposed for noncompliance.
Many homeowners have inherited their sump pump configurations and do not realize कि the pump discharges to the sewer.
If the discharge is fed to a laundry sink in the basement, it 's likely going to the सीवर.
प्रायः hardwired into a home 's electrical system, sump pumps may have a battery बैकअप.
The home 's pressurized water सप्लाई powers some पंपों, eliminating the need for electricity at the expense of using potable जल, potentially making them more expensive to operate than electrical pumps and creating an additional water निपटान problem.
Since a sump basin may overflow if not constantly pumped, a backup system is important for cases when the main power is out for prolonged periods of time, as during a severe storm.
वहीँ are generally two types of sump pumps — pedestal और submersible.
The pedestal pump 's motor is mounted above the sump, where it is more easily serviced, but is also more conspicuous.
The pump impeller is driven by a long, vertical extension shaft and the impeller is in a scroll housing in the base of the pump.
The submersible pump is entirely mounted inside the sump, and is specially sealed to prevent electrical short circuits.
Sump pump systems are also utilized in industrial and commercial applications to control water table -related problems in surface soil.
an artesian aquifer or periodic high जल तालिका situation can कारण the ground to become unstable due to water saturation.
As long as the pump functions, the surface soil will remain stable.
These sumps are typically ten feet in depth or more ; lined with corrugated metal pipe that contains perforations or drain holes throughout.
They may शामिल electronic control systems with visual and audible alarms and are usually covered to prevent debris and animals from falling in.
Bleeding Kansas, Bloody कान्सास or the Border War, थी a series of violent राजनैतिक confrontations involving anti-slavery Free-Staters and pro-slavery `` Border Ruffian `` elements, that took place in the Kansas Territory and the neighboring कस्बों of Missouri between 1854 and 1861.
At the heart of the conflict was the question of whether Kansas would डालें the Union as a free state or slave state.
as such, Bleeding Kansas was a proxy war between Northerners and Southerners over the समस्या of slavery in the संयुक्त States.
the term `` Bleeding Kansas '' was coined by Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune ; the events it encompasses directly presaged the American Civil War.
Congress had long struggled to balance the interests of pro-slavery forces and anti-slavery forces.
The events later known as Bleeding Kansas were set into motion by the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, which nullified the Missouri Compromise and instead implemented the concept of popular sovereignty.
An ostensibly democratic idea, popular sovereignty stated that the inhabitants of each territory or state should decide whether it would be a free or slave state ; however, this resulted in immigration en masse to Kansas by activists from both sides.
At one point, Kansas had two पृथक governments, each with its own constitution, although only one थी federally पहचाना.
On January 29, 1861, Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state, less than three months before the Battle of Fort Sumter which began the Civil War.
बेंजीन is an organic chemical compound साथ the molecular formula C6 H|Hydrogen|H6.
Its molecule is रचित of 6 कार्बन atoms joined in a रिंग, with 1 hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom.
Because its molecules contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon.
Benzene is a natural constituent of crude oil, and is one of the most basic petrochemicals.
Benzene is an aromatic hydrocarbon and the दूसरी [ n ] - annulene ( [ 6 ] -annulene ), a cyclic hydrocarbon with a निरन्तर pi bond.
It is sometimes abbreviated Ph –H. Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell.
It is mainly used as a precursor to heavy chemicals, such as ethylbenzene and cumene, which are produced on a billion kilogram scale.
Because it has a high octane number, it is an important component of gasoline, composing a few percent of its mass.
Most non-industrial applications have been limited by benzene 's carcinogenicity.

Take identical growing plants और give fertilizer to half of them.
If there हैं differences between the fertilized plant group and the unfertilized `` control '' group, these differences may be due to the fertilizer.
A scientific control is an experiment or observation designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable.
This increases the reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements.
Scientific controls are a part of the scientific method.
For example, during drug testing, scientists will try to कंट्रोल two समूह to keep उन्हें as identical as possible, then allow एक group to try the drug.
Another example might be परीक्षण plant fertilizer by giving it to only half the plants in a garden : the plants that receive no fertilizer हैं the control group, because they establish the baseline level of growth that the fertilizer-treated plants will be compared against.
Without a control group, the experiment can not determine whether the fertilizer-treated plants grow more than they would have if untreated.
Ideally, all variables in an प्रयोग will be controlled ( accounted for by the control measurements ) and none will be uncontrolled.
In ऐसे an experiment, if all the controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment is working as intended और that the results of the experiment are due to the effect of the variable being tested.
That is, वैज्ञानिक controls allow an investigator to make a claim जैसे `` Two situations were identical until factor x occurred.
Since factor X is the only difference between the two situations, the new outcome was caused by factor X. ''

In chemistry and physics, Dalton 's law ( also called Dalton 's law of partial pressures ) राज्य that the total pressure exerted by the मिश्रण of non-reactive gases is equal to the sum of the आंशिक pressures of individual gases.
This empirical विधि was observed by John Dalton in 1801 and is related to the ideal gas laws.
Mathematically, the pressure of a mixture of gases can be defined as the summation
or
where represent the partial दबाव of each component.
It is assumed that the गैसों do not react with each other
where is the mole fraction of the i-th component in the कुल mixture of n components.
The relationship below provides a way to determine the volume based concentration of any individual gaseous component
where is the concentration of the i-th component expressed in ppm.
Dalton 's law is not exactly followed by real gases.
Those deviations are considerably large at high pressures.
In such conditions, the volume occupied by the molecules can become significant compared to the free space between उन्हें.
In particular, the short औसत distances between molecules उठाता the intensity of intermolecular forces between गैस molecules enough to substantially change the pressure exerted by them.
Neither of those effects are considered by the ideal gas model.

Many antipsychotic drugs accordingly निशाना the dopamine system ; meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of these दवाएँ, however, show either no significant difference between drug and placebo, or a very small प्रभाव size, suggesting that the pathophysiology of psychosis is much more complex than an overactive dopamine system.
People experiencing psychosis may exhibit some personality changes and thought disorder.
Depending on its severity, this may be accompanied by unusual or bizarre बर्ताव, as well as difficulty with सोशल interaction and impairment in carrying out daily life क्रियाएँ.

Statistics play an important role in summarizing बेसबॉल performance and evaluating players in the sport.
Since the flow of a baseball game has natural ब्रेक to it, and normally players act individually rather than performing in clusters, the खेल lends itself to easy record-keeping और statistics.
Statistics have been kept for professional baseball since the creation of the National League and American League, now part of Major League Baseball.
Many statistics are also available from outside of Major लीग Baseball, from leagues such as the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players and the Negro Leagues.

The unemployment rate in the US 1910–1960, with the years of the Great Depression ( 1929–1939 ) highlighted.
The ग्रेट Depression was a कठोर worldwide economic depression in the decade preceding संसार War II.
The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations, but in most countries it started in 1930 and lasted until the late 1930s or मध्य 1940s.
It was the longest, most widespread, and deepest depression of the 20th century.
In the 21st century, the Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how far the world 's economy can decline.
The depression originated in the U.S., after the fall in stock कीमतें that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929 ( known as Black Tuesday ).
The Great अवसाद had विनाशकारी प्रभाव in countries rich and poor.
Personal income, कर revenue, profits and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50 %.
Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25 %, और in some countries rose as high as 33 %.
Cities all around the world were hit hard, especially those निर्भर on heavy industry.
Construction was virtually halted in अनेक countries.
Farming and ग्रामीण areas suffered as crop prices fell by approximately 60 %.
Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs, areas dependent on primary sector industries such as cash cropping, mining and logging suffered the most.
Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s.
In many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the end of World युद्ध II.
A premature ventricular contraction ( PVC ), also known as a premature ventricular complex, ventricular premature contraction ( or complex or देवालय ) ( VPC ), ventricular premature ताल ( VPB ), or ventricular extrasystole ( VES ), is a relatively common event where the heartbeat is initiated by purkinje fibres in the ventricles बल्कि than by the sinoatrial node, the normal heartbeat initiator.
The electrical events of the heart detected by the electrocardiogram allow a PVC to be easily distinguished from a normal heart beat.
A PVC may be perceived as a `` skipped beat `` or felt as palpitations in the chest.
In a normal heartbeat, the ventricles contract after the atria have helped to fill them by contracting ; in this way the ventricles can pump a maximized amount of blood both to the lungs and to the rest of the body.
In a PVC, the ventricles contract first and before the atria have optimally filled the ventricles with blood, which means that circulation is inefficient.
However, single ताल PVC arrhythmias do not प्रायः pose a danger and can be asymptomatic in स्वस्थ individuals.
William Gary Busey ( born June 29, 1944 ), better known as Gary Busey, is an American film and stage actor, and artist.
He has appeared in a variety of films, including Lethal Weapon, Point Break, और Under Siege, as well as guest appearances on Gunsmoke, Walker, Texas Ranger, Law & Order, and Entourage.
He was nominated लिये an Academy Award for Best Actor in 1978 for his role in The Buddy होली Story.
The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ), is a multinational treaty for the purpose of establishing international standards for intellectual property rights enforcement.
The agreement aims to establish an अंतरराष्ट्रीय legal framework लिये targeting counterfeit goods, generic medicines and copyright infringement on the अंतरजाल, and would बनाएँ a new governing देह outside मौजूदा forums, such as the World Trade संगठन, the World Intellectual Property Organization, or the United राष्ट्र.
The agreement was signed in अक्तूबर 2011 by Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and the United States.
In 2012, Mexico, the European Union and 22 countries which are सदस्य states of the European Union signed as well.
One signatory ( Japan ) has ratified ( formally approved ) the agreement, which would come into force in countries that ratified it after ratification by six countries.
Supporters have described the agreement as a response to `` the increase in global trade of counterfeit goods and pirated कापीराइट protected works ''.
ट्रेड Unions representing workers in the music, film and TV उद्योग and large intellectual property-based organizations such as the Motion Picture Association of America and Pharmaceutical Research और Manufacturers of America were active in the treaty 's development.
Opponents say the convention adversely affects fundamental rights including freedom of expression and privacy.
ACTA has also been criticised by Doctors Without Borders for endangering access to medicines in developing countries.
The secret nature of negotiations has excluded सिविल society groups, developing countries and the general public from the agreement 's negotiation process and it रै been described as policy laundering by critics सहित the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Entertainment Consumers Association.
The signature of the EU and many of its member राज्य resulted in the resignation in protest of the European Parliament 's appointed chief अन्वेषक, rapporteur Kader Arif, as well as widespread protests across Europe.
in 2012 the newly-appointed rapporteur, अंग्रेजों MEP David Martin, recommended against the treaty, stating : `` The intended benefits of this international agreement are far outweighed by the potential threats to civil liberties ''.
On 4 July 2012, the European Parliament rejected the agreement in plenary session, with 478 voting against the सन्धि, 39 in favour and 165 MEPs abstaining.
FAW semi-trailer truck in China
Tractor with side dump trailer semi-trailer
A tractor with an auto-transport semi-trailer.
Semi-trailer truck with sleeper behind the cab.
A semi-trailer truck is an articulated vehicle that consists of a towing engine, known as a tractor in the United राज्य and truck in many other places, attached to one or more semi-trailers to carry freight.
It is also known as a हस्तांतरण in Canada, prime mover in Australia, semi, tractor-trailer, truck और trailer, ट्रांसफ़र truck, 18-wheeler, mack truck, big rig in the United States, or artic, short for articulated lorry, in Britain and आयरलैंड.
A semi-trailer करता not trail completely behind the towing vehicle, लकिन is attached at a point that is just forward of the rear-most axle of the towing unit.
This is done so that a fraction of the weight of the trailer is carried by the prime mover.
This arrangement means that both tractor and semi-trailer will have a distinctly different design than a rigid ट्रक and trailer.
The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional फ़ुटबॉल team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The team currently belongs to the North Division of the American Football Conference ( afc ) in the National Football League ( NFL ).
Founded in, the Steelers are the oldest franchise in the AFC.
पिट्सबर्ग has won more Super कटोरी titles ( six ), won more AFC Championship Games ( eight ) and played in ( fifteen ) and hosted more ( ग्यारह ) conference championship games than any other AFC or NFC team.
The Steelers share the record लिये सबसे Super Bowl appearances with the Dallas Cowboys ( eight ).
The Steelers जीती their most recent championship, Super Bowl XLIII, on फ़रवरी 1, 2009.
The Steelers were founded as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933, by Art Rooney, taking its original name from the baseball team of the same name, as was common practice for NFL teams to do at the time.
The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the रूनी family चूंकि its founding.
The current owner is Art 's son, Dan Rooney, जो रै given much control of the मताधिकार to his son आर्ट Rooney II.
Long one of the NFL 's flagship teams, the Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation.
The Steelers currently play their home games at Heinz Field on Pittsburgh 's North Side in the North shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers.
Built in 2001, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium which hosted the Steelers for 31 सीज़न.
prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had निभाई their games in Pitt Stadium and फोर्ब्स Field.
तीन different kinds of wheat and rye flour
Flour is a powder जिससे is made by grinding cereal grains, or other seeds or roots ( like Cassava ).
It is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures, making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and राजनैतिक issue at विभिन्न times throughout history.
Wheat flour is one of the most important foods in European, North American, Middle Eastern, Indian और North African cultures, and is the defining ingredient in सबसे of their styles of breads and pastries.
While wheat is the सबसे common base for flour, corn flour has been important in Mesoamerican cuisine since प्राचीन times, and remains a staple throughout the Americas.
Rye flour is an important constituent of bread in much of central Europe, and राइस can also be used in flour, though this is relatively uncommon.
Heart rate is the number of heartbeats per unit of time, typically expressed as beats per minute ( bpm ).
Heart rate can vary as the body 's need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon डाइऑक्साइड changes, such as during physical कसरत, sleep, illness, or as a परिणाम of ingesting drugs :
Central nervous system stimulants such as amphetamines increase heart rate.
सेंट्रल बेचैन system depressants or sedatives decreases the heart rate ( apart from कुछ particularly strange ones with equally strange effects, such as ketamine which can cause - amongst many other things - stimulant-like effects such as tachycardia ).
वहीँ are many ways in which the heart rate speeds up or slows down.
Most involve stimulant-like endorphins and hormones being released in the brain, many of which are those that are 'forced'/'enticed ' out by the ingestion and processing of drugs.
Due to individuals having a constant blood volume, one of the physiological ways to deliver more oxygen to an organ is to increase heart rate to permit blood to pass by the organ more often.
Normal resting heart rates range from 60-100 bpm.
Bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below 60 bpm.
However, heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention.
Tachycardia is defined as a resting heart रेट above 100 bpm, हालांकि persistent rest rates between 80-100 bpm, mainly if they are present during sleep, may be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia ( see below ).
Catherine II 's carved, painted and gilded Coronation Coach ( Hermitage Museum )
A carriage is a wheeled vehicle for people, usually horse-drawn ; litters ( palanquins ) and sedan chairs हैं excluded, since they are wheelless vehicles.
The carriage is especially designed for private passenger use and for comfort or लालित्य, though some are also used to transport goods.
it may be light, smart and fast or heavy, large and comfortable.
Carriages normally have suspension using leaf springs, elliptical springs ( in the 19th century ) or leather strapping.
A public passenger vehicle would not usually be called a carriage – terms for such include stagecoach, charabanc and omnibus.
Working vehicles such as the ( four-wheeled ) wagon and ( two-wheeled ) cart share important parts of the history of the carriage, as is the fast ( two-wheeled ) chariot.
The 2004 Indian Ocean भूकंप was an undersea megathrust earthquake that occurred at 00:58:53 UTC on Sunday, 26 December 2004, with an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia.
the quake itself is known by the scientific जातियाँ as the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake.
The resulting tsunami was given various names, including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, South Asian tsunami, Indonesian tsunami, and the Boxing Day tsunami.
The earthquake was caused by subduction and triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean, killing over 230,000 people in fourteen countries, and inundating coastal communities with waves up to high.
It was एक of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history.
Indonesia was the hardest-hit country, followed by Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand.
साथ a magnitude of Mw 9.1–9.3, it is the third largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph.
the earthquake था the longest duration of faulting ever observed, between 8.3 and 10 minutes.
It caused the entire planet to हिलना as much as and triggered other earthquakes as far away as Alaska.
Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Indonesia.
The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a विश्वव्यापी humanitarian response.
in all, the worldwide community donated more than $ 14 billion ( 2004 US $ ) in humanitarian aid.
Steam rising from the Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station in Iceland.
Geothermal energy is thermal energy generated और stored in the Earth.
थर्मल energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter.
The Geothermal energy of the धरती 's crust originates from the original formation of the planet ( 20 % ) and from radioactive decay of minerals ( 80 % ).
The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in तापमान between the core of the ग्रह and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of थर्मल उर्जा in the form of heat from the core to the surface.
The adjective geothermal originates इससे the Greek roots γη ( ge ), meaning earth, and θερμος ( thermos ), meaning hot.
At the core of the धरती, थर्मल energy is created by radioactive decay and temperatures may reach over 5000 °C ( 9,000 °F ).
ऊष्मा conducts from the core to surrounding cooler rock.
The high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt, creating magma convection upward since it is lighter than the solid rock.
The magma heats rock and water in the crust, sometimes up to 370 °C ( 700 °F ).
From hot springs, geothermal energy has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since प्राचीन Roman टाइम्स, but it is अभी better known for electricity generation.
Worldwide, about 10,715 megawatts ( MW ) of geothermal power is online in 24 countries.
an additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications.
Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly, but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate सीमाएँ.
हाल technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable संसाधन, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation.
Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the धरती, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.
As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels.
the Earth 's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity 's energy needs, but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited.
Drilling and exploration for गहन resources is very expensive.
Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology, energy कीमतें, subsidies, and interest rates.
Pilot programs like EWEB 's customer opt in Green Power कार्यक्रम show that customers would be willing to pay a little अधिक लिये a renewable energy source like geothermal.
But as a result of government assisted research and industry experience, the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25 % over the past two decades.
In 2001, geothermal energy cost between two and ten cents per kwh.
The term cubic foot is an Imperial and US customary ( non- metric ) ईकाई of volume, used in the संयुक्त States and the United Kingdom.
It is defined as the volume of a cube with sides of one foot ( 0.3048 m ) in length.
To calculate cubic feet गुणा length X width X height.
Hồ Chí Minh ( उत्तरी Vietnamese pronunciation :, Southern Vietnamese pronunciation : ) ; 19 May 1890 – 2 September 1969 ), born Nguyễn Sinh Cung and also known as Nguyễn Tất Thành and Nguyễn Ái Quốc, was a Vietnamese communist revolutionary leader who was prime minister ( 1945–1955 ) and president ( 1945–1969 ) of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( North Vietnam ).
He was a key figure in the foundation of the Democratic Republic of वियतनाम in 1945, as well as the People’s Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) and the việt Cộng ( NLF or VC ) during the Vietnam War.
He led the Việt मिन्ह independence movement from 1941 onward, establishing the communist -ruled Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 और defeating the फ्रेंच Union in 1954 at the battle of Điện Biên Phủ.
He officially stepped down from power in 1955 due to health problems, but remained a highly visible figurehead and inspiration for those वियतनामी लड़ for his cause—a united, कम्युनिस्ट Vietnam—until his death.
बाद the युद्ध, Saigon, capital of the Republic of Vietnam, थी renamed Hồ Chí Minh City.

Sales taxes in the United States हैं taxes placed on the sale or पट्टे of goods and services in the United States.
While no national general sales tax exists, the federal government levies several national selective sales taxes on the sale or lease of particular goods and services.
Furthermore, forty-five states, the District of Columbia, and Guam impose general sales taxes that apply to the बिक्री or lease of सबसे goods and some services, and states also may levy selective sales taxes on the sale or lease of particular goods or services.
States may also delegate to local governments the authority to impose additional general or selective sales taxes.
Sales tax is calculated by multiplying the purchase price by the applicable कर rate.
Tax rates vary widely by jurisdiction and range from less than 1 % to over 10 %.
Sales tax is एकत्रित by the seller at the time of sale.
Use tax is self assessed by a buyer who has not paid sales tax on a taxable purchase.
Unlike the value added tax, a sales tax is imposed only once, at the retail level.
However, in cases where items are sold at retail more than once, such as प्रयुक्त गाड़ियाँ, the sales tax can be charged on the same item indefinitely.
the definition of retail sales and what goods and services are taxable vary among the states.
Nearly all jurisdictions provide numerous categories of goods और services that are exempt from sales कर, or taxed at reduced rates.
The purchase of goods for further manufacture or लिये पुनर्विक्रय is uniformly exempt from बिक्री tax.
Most jurisdictions exempt food sold in grocery स्टोर्स, prescription medications, और many agricultural supplies.
Sales taxes, including those imposed by local governments, are generally administered at the state level.
States imposing sales tax आवश्यकता retail sellers to collect tax इससे customers, file returns, and remit the कर to the state.
Procedural rules vary widely.
Sellers generally must collect tax from in-state purchasers unless the purchaser provides an exemption certificate.
Most राज्य allow or require electronic remittance.
A central processing ईकाई ( CPU ), also referred to as a central processor unit, is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, लॉजिकल, and input/output operations of the system.
The term has been in use in the computer उद्योग at least since the early 1960s.
the form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their इतिहास, but उनके fundamental operation remains much the वही.
A computer can have अधिक than one CPU ; this is called multiprocessing.
Some integrated circuits ( ICs ) can contain multiple CPUs on a single chip ; those ICs are called multi-core processors.
Two ठेठ components of a CPU are the arithmetic logic unit ( ALU ), which performs arithmetic and logical operations, and the control ईकाई ( CU ), which extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them, calling on the alu when necessary.
Not all computational systems rely on a central processing unit.
An array processor or vector processor has multiple parallel computing elements, with no one unit considered the `` बीच ''.
in the distributed computing model, problems are solved by a distributed interconnected set of processors.
RFID chip अगला to a grain of rice.
This chip contains a radio-frequency electromagnetic field coil that modulates an बाह्य magnetic field to transfer a coded identification number when queried by a reader यंत्र.
This small type is incorporated in consumer products, और implanted in pets, for identification purposes.
Radio-frequency identification ( RFID ) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency electromagnetic फ़ील्ड to transfer data, for the purposes of automatically identifying और tracking tags attached to objects.
The tags contain electronically stored information.
Some tags हैं powered and read at short ranges ( a few meters ) via magnetic fields ( electromagnetic induction ).
Others use a local power source such as a बैटरी, or else have no battery but collect energy from the interrogating EM field, and then act as a passive transponder to emit microwaves or UHF radio waves ( i.e., electromagnetic radiation at high frequencies ).
Battery powered टैग may operate at hundreds of meters.
Unlike a bar code, the tag does not necessarily need to be within line of sight of the reader, and may be embedded in the tracked object.
RFID tags are प्रयुक्त in many industries.
An RFID tag attached to an automobile दौरान production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line.
Pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses.
Livestock and pets may have tags injected, allowing धनात्मक identification of the animal.
Since RFID tags can be attached to clothing, possessions, or even implanted within लोगों, the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised privacy concerns.
Overtime is the amount of time someone works beyond normal working hours.
Normal hours may be determined in several ways:
by custom ( what is माना healthy or reasonable by समाज ),
by practices of a given trade or profession,
by legislation,
by agreement between employers and workers or their representatives.
Most nations have overtime labor laws designed to dissuade or prevent employers from forcing their employees to work excessively long hours.
These laws may take into account other considerations than the humanitarian, such as preserving the health of workers so that they may continue to be productive, or increasing the overall level of नियुक्ति in the economy.
One common approach to regulating overtime is to require employers to pay workers at a higher hourly rate for overtime work.
Companies may choose to pay workers higher overtime pay even if not obliged to do so by law, विशेषकर if they believe that they face a backward bending supply curve of श्रमिक.
Overtime pay rates can cause workers to work longer hours than they would at a flat hourly रेट.
Overtime laws, attitudes toward overtime and hours of work vary greatly from देश to country और between different economic sectors.
Visualization of links between pages on a wiki using a force-directed layout.
Force-directed graph drawing algorithms are a class of algorithms for drawing graphs in an aesthetically pleasing way.
Their purpose is to position the nodes of a आलेख in two-dimensional or three-dimensional स्पेस so that all the edges are of अधिक or less equal length and वहीँ are as few crossing edges as possible, by assigning forces among the set of edges and the set of nodes, based on their relative positions, and तब using these forces either to simulate the motion of the edges and nodes or to minimize their energy.
While graph drawing can be a difficult problem, force-directed algorithms, being physical simulations, usually require no special knowledge about graph theory such as planarity.
Purchasing power ( sometimes retroactively called adjusted for inflation ) is the राशि of goods or services that can be purchased with a unit of currency.
For example, if you had taken one dollar to a store in the 1950s, तुम होता have been able to buy a greater number of items than you होता आज, indicating that you would have had a greater purchasing power in the 1950s.
करेंसी can be either a commodity धन, like सुनहरा or silver, or fiat currency, or free-floating market-valued currency like US dollars.
As Adam Smith noted, having money देता one the ability to `` command '' others ' labor, so purchasing power to some extent is power over other people, to the extent that they are willing to व्यापार their labor or goods for money or currency.
If one 's monetary income stays the same, but the price स्तर increases, the purchasing power of कि income falls.
Inflation does not सदा imply falling purchasing power of one 's money income since it may rise faster than the price level.
A उच्चतर real income means a higher purchasing power since real income refers to the income adjusted लिये inflation.
For a price index, its value in the base year is usually normalized to a value of 100.
The purchasing power of a unit of currency, say a dollar, in a given year, expressed in डॉलर of the base year, is 100/P, where P is the price index in that year.
So, by definition the purchasing power of a dollar decreases as the price level उदय.
The purchasing power in today 's money of an amount C of धन, t years into the future, can be computed with the सूत्र for the present value :
where in this case i is an assumed future annual inflation rate.
Education in South Korea is viewed as being crucial for success और competition is consequently very heated and fierce.
A central administration oversees the प्रक्रम for the शिक्षा of children from kindergarten to the third and final year of high school.
गणित, science, कोरियाई, English, and social studies are generally considered to be the most important subjects.
Normally physical शिक्षा is नहीं considered महत्वपूर्ण as it is not recognised, by the generally academic elitist South Korean populace, as education और therefore many schools lack high-quality gymnasiums and varsity athletics.
South Korea was the first country in the संसार to provide high-speed internet अभिगम to all primary, junior, and high schools.
Although South Korean students often rank highly on international comparative assessments जब compared to students of most पश्चिमी education systems, the South Korean शिक्षा system is criticised for emphasising too much upon passive learning and memorisation.
The South Korean education system is rather notably सख्त and overly structured as compared to its counterparts in most पश्चिमी societies.
Also, the prevalence of non-school for-profit private institutes such as academies or cram-schools ( Hagwon [ 학원 ] ), which too emphasise on passive memorisation, as opposed to conceptual understanding, in students are criticised as a major social problem.
The My Lai Massacre (, ;,, or ) was the Vietnam War mass murder of between 347 and 504 unarmed civilians in South Vietnam on March 16, 1968, by United States Army soldiers of `` Charlie '' Company of 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 11th Brigade of the Americal Division.
Victims included women, मेन, children, and infants.
Some of the women यहूद gang-raped and their bodies were later found to be mutilated and many women were allegedly raped prior to the killings.
While 26 U.S. soldiers were initially charged with criminal offenses for their actions at mỹ Lai, only Second Lieutenant William Calley, a platoon leader in Charlie Company, was convicted.
Found अपराधी of killing 22 villagers, he थी originally given a जीवन sentence, but only served three and a half सालो under house arrest.
The massacre took place in the hamlets of My Lai and My Khe of Son My village.
The event is also ज्ञात as the Son My Massacre, especially in the Vietnamese state media.
The U.S. military codeword for the `` Viet Cong stronghold '' was `` Pinkville ''.
The incident prompted global outrage when it became public knowledge in 1969.
The नरसंहार भी increased घरेलू opposition to the u.S. भागीदारी in the Vietnam War.
Three U.S. servicemen who had tried to halt the massacre and protect the wounded were initially denounced by several U.S. Congressmen as traitors.
They received hate mail और death threats and found mutilated animals on their doorsteps.
The three were later widely praised and decorated by the Army for their heroic actions.
The hijackers in the September 11 attacks were 19 men affiliated with al-Qaeda, and 15 of the 19 यहूद citizens of Saudi Arabia.
Others were from Egypt, Lebanon, and the UAE.
The hijackers were organized into four teams, each led by a pilot-trained hijacker with four `` muscle hijackers '' who were trained to help subdue the pilots, passengers, and crew.
The first hijackers to arrive in the संयुक्त States were Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who settled in the San Diego क्षेत्रफल in January 2000.
They were followed by three hijacker-pilots, Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah early in the summer of 2000 to undertake flight training in south Florida.
The fourth hijacker-pilot, Hani Hanjour, arrived in San Diego in December 2000.
The rest of the `` muscle hijackers '' arrived in the spring and early summer of 2001, just months before the September 11 attacks.
Abū al-Qāsim Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh इब्न ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib ibn Hāshim ( ) ( circa| 570 – circa| 8 June 632 ), also transliterated as Muhammad ( ), was a religious, political, and military leader from Mecca who unified Arabia into a single religious polity under Islam.
He is believed by Muslims and Bahá'ís to be a messenger और prophet of God.
Muhammad is almost universally considered by Muslims as the last prophet sent by God for mankind.
Non-Muslims regard Muhammad as the founder of islam.
Muslims consider him to be the restorer of an unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, यीशु, and other prophets.
Born in about 570 CE in the Arabian नगर of Mecca, he was orphaned at an जल्दी age and brought up under the care of his uncle Abu Talib.
He later worked ज़्यादातर as a merchant, as well as a shepherd, and was first शादीशुदा by age 25.
Being in the habit of periodically retreating to a cave in the surrounding mountains for several nights of seclusion and prayer, he later reported that it was there, at age 40, that he received his first revelation from God.
Three years after this event Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that `` God is एक ``, that पूरा `` आत्मसमर्पण '' to Him ( lit.
islām ) is the only way ( dīn ) acceptable to God, and कि he himself थी a prophet and messenger of God, in the वही vein as other Islamic prophets.
Muhammad gained few followers early on, और was met with hostility from कुछ Meccan tribes ; he and his followers were treated harshly.
to एस्केप persecution, मुहम्मद भेजा some of उसके followers to अबीसीनिया पहले he and his followers in Mecca migrated to Medina ( then ज्ञात as Yathrib ) in the year 622.
This event, the हिज्र, marks the beginning of the Islamic पंचांग, which is also known as the Hijri Calendar.
In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina.
After eight years of fighting with the Meccan tribes, his followers, who by then had grown to 10,000, took control of Mecca in the largely peaceful conquest of Mecca.
He destroyed the pagan idols in the city and then sent his followers out to destroy सब of the remaining pagan temples in Eastern Arabia.
In 632, a few months after returning to Medina इससे The Farewell Pilgrimage, Muhammad fell ill and died.
By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam, and he had united Arabia into a single मुस्लिम religious polity.
The revelations ( or Ayah, lit.
`` Signs [ of God ] '' ) — which Muhammad reported receiving until his death – form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the `` Word of God '' और around which the religion is based.

She has been called the `` matriarch और महारानी mother of black dance ''.
During her heyday in the 1940s and 1950s, Dunham was renowned throughout Europe and Latin America and थी widely popular in the United States, where the Washington Post called her `` dancer Katherine the Great ''.

Sphagnum is a genus of between 1510 and 3500 species of mosses, commonly called peat moss due to its prevalence in wet habitats where it contributes to the formation of peat bogs and mires.
sphagnum accumulations can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells ; plants may hold from 16-26 टाइम्स as much water as their dry weight depending on the species.
the empty cells help retain जल in drier conditions.
Hence, as sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger peatlands, दोनो raised bogs and blanket bogs.
These peat accumulations तब provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants.
Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss 's cell walls.
In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action.
Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as कैल्सियम and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions.
Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters.
Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding और ph, so any one peatland may have a number of अलग Sphagnum species.
Individual peat मॉस plants consist of a main stem, with tightly arranged clusters of branch fascicles usually consisting of two or three spreading branches and two to four hanging branches.
The top of the संयंत्र, or capitulum, has compact clusters of young शाखाओं.
Along the stem are scattered leaves of various shapes, नामित stem leaves ; the आकार varies according to species.
The leaves consist of two kinds of cells ; small, green, living cells ( chlorophyllose cells ), and large, clear, संरचनात्मक, मुर्दे cells ( hyaline cells ).
The latter have the large water-holding क्षमता.

Kennedy gained since there was an economic recession which hurt the लाज़िम Republican, and he had the लाभ of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans.
Furthermore, the new votes that Kennedy gained among Catholics almost neutralized the new votes Nixon gained among Protestants.
Kennedy 's campaigning skills decisively outmatched Nixon 's.
in the end, Nixon 's emphasis on his experience carried छोटी weight, and he wasted energy by campaigning in all 50 states instead of concentrating on the swing states.
Kennedy used his large, well-funded campaign organization to win the nomination, secure समर्थन, and, with the aid of the last of the big-city bosses, to get out the vote in the big cities.

The Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) was enacted into law by the Congress of the United राज्य as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970.
The CSA is the federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and वितरण of certain substances is regulated.
The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
The legislation created five Schedules ( classifications ), with varying qualifications for a substance to be included in each.
Two संघीय agencies, the Drug प्रवर्तन प्रशासन and the Food and Drug Administration, determine which substances are added to or removed from the various schedules, though the statute passed by Congress created the initial listing, and Congress has sometimes scheduled other substances through legislation ऐसे as the hillory J.

Second-language acquisition or second-language learning is the process by जिससे people learn a दूसरी language.
second-language acquisition ( often abbreviated to SLA ) also refers to the scientific discipline devoted to studying that process.
Second language refers to any language learned in addition to a person 's first language ; although the concept is named second-language acquisition, it can also incorporate the learning of third, fourth, or subsequent languages.
Second-language acquisition refers to what learners do ; it does नहीं refer to practices in language teaching.
The academic अनुशासन of second-language acquisition is a subdiscipline of लागू linguistics.
It is broad-based and relatively नई.
As well as the various branches of linguistics, second-language acquisition is also closely related to psychology, cognitive psychology, and शिक्षा.
To separate the academic discipline from the learning process itself, the terms second-language acquisition research, second-language studies, and second-language acquisition studies are also used.
SLA research began as an interdisciplinary field, and because of this it is difficult to identify a precise starting date.
However, it does appear to have developed a great deal since the mid-1960s.
the term acquisition was originally used to emphasize the subconscious nature of the learning process, but in recent years learning and acquisition have become largely synonymous.
Second-language acquisition can incorporate विरासत language learning, but it does not usually incorporate bilingualism.
Most SLA researchers see bilingualism as being the end result of learning a language, not the process itself, and see the पद as referring to native-like fluency.
Writers in fields such as education and psychology, however, often use bilingualism loosely to refer to all फ़ॉर्म of multilingualism.
Second-language acquisition is भी not to be contrasted with the acquisition of a foreign भाषा ; rather, the learning of second languages and the learning of foreign languages involve the same fundamental processes in different situations..
There has been much बहस about exactly कैसा language is सीखे, and many issues are स्टिल unresolved.
There are many theories of second-language acquisition, but none are accepted as a complete explanation by all SLA researchers.
Due to the interdisciplinary प्रकृति of the field of second-language acquisition, this is नहीं अपेक्षित to happen in the foreseeable future.

In foods of animal origin, the प्रमुख form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily retinyl palmitate, which is converted to retinol ( chemically an alcohol ) in the small intestine.
The रेटिनॉल form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and can be converted to and from its visually active सुव्युद form, retinal.
The associated acid ( retinoic acid ), a metabolite कि can be irreversibly synthesized from vitamin A, has only partial विटामिन A activity, and does not function in the retina for the visual cycle.
Retinoic acid is used for growth and cellular differentiation.
सब forms of vitamin A have a beta-ionone ring to which an isoprenoid कड़ी is attached, called a retinyl group.
Both संरचनात्मक features are essential for vitamin activity.
The orange pigment of carrots – beta-carotene – can be represented as two connected retinyl समूह, which are used in the body to contribute to vitamin a levels.
Alpha-carotene and gamma-carotene also have a single retinyl group, which give them some vitamin activity.
None of the other carotenes have vitamin activity.
The carotenoid beta- cryptoxanthin possesses an ionone group और has vitamin activity in humans.
Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods :
Retinol, the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance.
Since the pure दारू form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester.
It is also commercially produced and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate.
The carotenes alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene ; and the xanthophyll beta-cryptoxanthin ( all of which contain beta-ionone rings ), but no other carotenoids, function as provitamin A in herbivores and omnivore animals, which possess the enzyme ( 15-15'-dioxygenase ) which cleaves beta-carotene in the intestinal mucosa and converts it retinol.
In general, carnivores are poor converters of ionine-containing carotenoids, and pure carnivores such as बिल्लियों and ferrets lack 15-15'-dioxygenase and can not convert any carotenoids to retinal ( resulting in none of the carotenoids being forms of vitamin A for these species ).

Located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, it lies geographically to the east of the Malay Archipelago, with which it is sometimes included as भाग of a greater Indo-Australian Archipelago.
Geologically it is a भाग of the same tectonic plate as Australia.
When world sea levels were low, the दो shared shorelines ( which now lie 100 to 140 metres below sea स्तर ), combining with lands now inundated into the tectonic continent of Sahul, also known as Greater Australia.
The दो landmasses became separated when the area now ज्ञात as the Torres Strait flooded after the end of the last glacial period.
Anthropologically, New Guinea is considered part of मॅलानिशिया.
Politically, the western half of the island comprises two Indonesian provinces : Papua and West Papua.
The eastern हाफ forms the मेनलैंड of the country of Papua New Guinea.
The island रै a population of about 7.5 million, with a very low population घनत्व of only 8 inh/km2.
नई Guinea is differentiated from its drier, flatter, and less fertile southern बंटवारा, Australia, by its much उच्चतर rainfall and its active volcanic geology, with its highest point, puncak Jaya, reaching an elevation of 4,884 m ( 16,023 ft ).
Yet the दो land masses share a similar animal fauna, with marsupials, including wallabies and possums, and the egg-laying monotreme, the spiny anteater, or echidna.
Other than bats and some two dozen indigenous rodent genera, there are no pre-human indigenous placental स्तनधारियों.

It is the primary source of पोषण for young mammals before they are समर्थ to digest अन्य types of food.
Early- lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother 's antibodies to the baby and can reduce the risk of many diseases in the baby.
It also contains many other nutrients.
As an agricultural product, milk is extracted from mammals and used as food for humans.
Worldwide, dairy farms produced about 730 लाख tonnes of milk in 2011.
India is the world 's largest producer and उपभोक्ता of milk, yet neither exports nor imports milk.
New Zealand, the European Union 's 27 member states, Australia, and the United States are the world 's largest exporters of milk and मिल्क products.
China और Russia are the world 's largest importers of milk and milk products.
throughout the world, there are more than 6 billion उपभोक्ता of milk and milk products.

Motorcycle speedway, usually referred to as speedway, is a motorcycle sport involving four and sometimes up to छह riders competing over four anti-clockwise laps of an oval circuit.
Speedway motorcycles use only one gear and have no brakes and racing takes place on a flat ओवल track usually consisting of dirt or loosely packed shale.
Competitors use this surface to slide their machines बगलों, powersliding or broadsiding into the bends.
On the straight sections of the track the motorcycles reach speeds of up.
The सटीक origins of the sport are अनजान but there is evidence of a type of speedway रेसिंग being practised in the USA before the First World War and in ऑस्ट्रेलिया in the late 1910s and early 1920s.

Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible for intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate.
In humans, the most महत्वपूर्ण related compounds of vitamin D are vitamin D2 and vitamin D3.
Cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) and ergocalciferol ( vitamin D2 ) are unique as they constitute what we जान as vitamin D और can be ingested from the diet and/or supplements.
the body can also synthesize vitamin d ( from cholesterol ) when sun एक्सपोज़र is adequate ( hence इसके nickname, the `` sunshine vitamin '' ).
हालांकि vitamin D is commonly called a vitamin, it is not actually an essential dietary विटामिन in the strict sense, as it can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sunlight.
( Cats and dogs can not synthesize vitamin d efficiently and must receive it in their diet. )
An organic chemical compound ( or related set of compounds ) is only scientifically called a vitamin when it can not be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must be प्राप्त from their diet.
However, as with other compounds commonly called vitamins, vitamin D was discovered in an effort to find the dietary substance that was lacking in a disease, namely, rickets, the childhood form of osteomalacia.
Additionally, like other compounds called vitamins, in the developed world vitamin D is added to staple foods, such as milk, to avoid disease due to कमियां.
Measures of serum levels reflect endogenous synthesis from exposure to sunlight as well as सेवन from the diet, and it is believed that synthesis may contribute generally to the मेंटेनेंस of adequate serum concentrations.
The evidence indicates that the संश्लेषण of vitamin D from सूर्य exposure works in a feedback loop that prevents toxicity but, because of uncertainty about the cancer risk इससे sunlight, no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine, USA, for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin d requirements.
तदनुसार, the Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin d assume that no synthesis occurs and that all of a person 's vitamin D is from their diet, although that will rarely occur in practice.
in the liver विटामिन D is converted to calcidiol, which is also known as calcifediol ( INN ), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D—abbreviated 25 ( OH ) D ; and which is the specific vitamin D metabolite that is measured in serum to determine a व्यक्ति 's vitamin D status.
Part of the calcidiol is परिवर्तित by the गुर्दे to calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D. calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood, regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the स्वस्थ growth and remodeling of bone.
Calcidiol is also परिवर्तित to calcitriol outside of the kidneys for other purposes, such as the proliferation, differentiation और apoptosis of cells ; calcitriol भी affects neuromuscular function and inflammation.
परे its use to prevent osteomalacia or rickets, the evidence for other health effects of vitamin D supplementation in the general population is inconsistent.
the best प्रमाण of benefit is for bone health and a decrease in mortality in elderly women.

Andreas Cellarius 's उदाहरण of the Copernican system, from the Harmonia Macrocosmica ( 1660 ).
Heliocentrism, or heliocentricism, is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around a relatively stationary Sun at the center of the Solar System.
The word comes from the यूनानी ( helios `` sun '' और kentron `` बीच '' ).
Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which लगाई the Earth at the center.
The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but Aristarchus 's heliocentrism attracted little attention until Copernicus revived and elaborated it.
Lucio Russo, however, argues that this is a misleading impression resulting from the loss of वैज्ञानिक works of the Hellenistic Era.
Using indirect evidence he argues that a heliocentric दृश्य was expounded in हिप्पारकस 's work on gravity.
It was not until the 16th century that a fully predictive mathematical model of a heliocentric प्रणाली was presented, by the Renaissance mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric Nicolaus Copernicus of कैंडल, leading to the Copernican Revolution.
In the following century, योहानेस Kepler elaborated upon and expanded this model to include elliptical orbits, and supporting observations made using a telescope were presented by Galileo Galilei.

Canadian इतिहासकारों until the 1980s tended to focus on economic history, including labour इतिहास.
in part this is because Canada has had far fewer political or military conflicts than other societies.
This was especially true in the first half of the बीसवीं century when आर्थिक history was overwhelmingly dominant.
Many of the most prominent English Canadian historians इससे this period were economic historians, such as Harold Innis, Donald Creighton and Arthur R. M. Lower
Scholars of Canadian history were heirs to the traditions that developed in Europe and the United States, but frameworks that worked well elsewhere often failed in Canada.
the heavily Marxist influenced economic history that dominates Europe has little relevance to most of Canadian history.
a फ़ोकस on class, शहरी areas, and industry fails to address कनाडा 's rural and resource based economy.
Similarly, the monetarist school that is dominant in the United States also has been difficult to transfer north of the border.
the study of economic history in Canada became highly focused on आर्थिक geography, and for many years the dominant school of thought has been the staples thesis.
This school of thought bases the study of the Canadian economy on the study of natural resources.
This approach रै since also become used बाहर of Canada in Australia and in many developing nations.
Before the आगमन of Europeans, the First Nations of what would become कनाडा had a large and vibrant trade network.
Furs, tools, decorative items, and other goods were often transported thousands of kilometres, mostly by कैनो throughout the many rivers and lakes of the region.
the early European history of the Canadian economy is usually studied through the staples thesis जिससे argues the कनाडाई economy developed through the exploitation of a series of staples कि would be exported to Europe.
Carbon-14, 14C, or radiocarbon, is a radioactive isotope of carbon with a nucleus containing 6 protons and 8 neutrons.
इसके presence in organic materials is the basis of the radiocarbon dating method pioneered by Willard Libby and colleagues ( 1949 ) to date archaeological, geological and hydrogeological samples.
Carbon-14 was discovered on 27 February 1940, by Martin Kamen and Sam रूबेन at the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, although its existence had been suggested by Franz Kurie in 1934.
There are three naturally occurring isotopes of carbon on धरती : 99 % of the carbon is carbon-12, 1 % is carbon-13, and carbon-14 occurs in trace amounts, i.e., making up about 1 part per trillion ( 0.0000000001 % ) of the carbon in the atmosphere.
The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730±40 years.
Carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14 through बीटा decay.
The primary natural source of carbon-14 on Earth is cosmic ray action upon nitrogen in the atmosphere, और it is इसलिए a cosmogenic nuclide.
However, open-air नाभिकीय testing between 1955–1980 contributed to this pool.
The different isotopes of carbon do not differ appreciably in their chemical properties.
This is used in chemical and biological research, in a technique called carbon labeling : carbon-14 atoms can be used to replace nonradioactive carbon, in order to trace chemical and biochemical reactions involving कार्बन अणु from any given organic compound.
Lightning is a highly visible form of energy transfer
Lightning strikes हैं electrical discharges on a विशाल स्केल between the atmosphere and an earth-bound object.
वे mostly originate in thunderclouds and terminate on the ground, called Cloud to Ground ( CG ) lightning.
however, they may also be initiated from a very tall grounded object and reach into the clouds.
हालांकि `` a lightning strike '' is commonly used to describe all lightning, it is बल्कि erroneous and a misnomer, as only परिचय 25 % of all lightning events worldwide are CG, the large bulk of lightning कार्यक्रम हैं Intracloud ( IC ) or बादल to Cloud ( CC ), where discharge only occurs high in the atmosphere.
The scientific name for the पूरा process of a single lightning event is a and it is a very complex, multiple stepped interaction, which is not completely understood.
Most CG flashes only `` strike '' one physical location, referred to as a termination.
The primary conducting चैनल, the bright coursing light you may see and call a `` strike '', is only about 1 inch in diameter, हालांकि to our आँखें it looks much larger.
They are miles long, upwards of tens of miles.
And the entire flash, lasts only a few fractions of a second, सबसे of which is not visible to human eyes.
Thunder is सदा उत्पादित by lightning.
Just like बिजली, that deceives our eyes, usually looking larger or closer than it really is, the धरती 's atmosphere and our brain 's बोध of the outside world, ultimately determines whether it is `` heard '' or not.
Lightning can नहीं happen in a vacuum devoid of ions, nor can thunder occur without molecules to vibrate.
Thunder is a शारीरिक absolute for प्रत्येक single flash of lightning.
Contrary to popular belief, a lightning strike itself is usually not responsible for multiple deaths or injuries from a सिंगल event.
It would be impossible given the natural tendencies of a flash, unless people or animals were stacked on top of each अन्य, or they were somehow arranged vertically and भाग of the flash चैनल.
When lightning ignites an available fuel source और an explosion occurs, it is the shock wave or fire causing the injuries, नहीं the strike itself.
Ground Currents, also called step संभावित, of an earth termination is what truly causes सबसे injuries or death to humans and animals.
The near instantaneous फटाफट of सतह charges, induced by the overhead thundercloud itself, race to the strike point from hundreds to thousands of feet दूर during discharge.
इस current, caused during each stroke, takes the पाथ of least resistance, which may be ion rich human or एनिमल legs, over poorly conducting earth.
This is why it is best to crouch, with feet close together, if ever caught in the open during a thunderstorm.
Unfortunately, सबसे reports do not draw a distinction between the real cause of injury or death, be it the strike itself, a resulting explosion or fire, or usually responsible step संभावित.

Sealing is an अध्यादेश ( ritual ) performed in Latter Day Saints temples by a person holding the sealing authority.
The purpose of this ordinance is to seal familiar relationships, making possible the existence of family संबंध throughout eternity.
LDS teachings place ग्रेट importance on the specific authority required to perform these sealings.
Church doctrine teaches that this authority, called the Priesthood, corresponds to that given to Saint Peter in.
Sealings are typically performed as विवाह or as sealing of children to parents.
They were performed prior to the death of Joseph स्मिथ, Jr. ( the main founder of the Latter Day Saint movement ), and are currently performed in The Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day Saints.
Although some other denominations, ऐसे as the Community of Christ, view sealing as an artifact of Smith 's practice of plural marriage, some do still perform them.

The Gunfight at the O.K. corral was a gunfight कि took place at about 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday, October 26, 1881, in tombstone, Arizona Territory, and is generally regarded as the most famous gunfight in the history of the American Old West.
The gunfight, believed to have lasted only about thirty seconds, was fought between the outlaw Cowboys Billy Claiborne, Ike and Billy Clanton, and Tom and Frank McLaury, and the opposing town Marshal Virgil Earp and his brothers Assistant Town Marshal Morgan and temporary lawman Wyatt, aided by Doc हॉलिडे designated as a temporary marshal by Virgil.
Ike Clanton and बिली Claiborne ran from the fight unharmed, but Ike 's brother Billy Clanton was killed, along with both McLaurys.
Lawmen Virgil and Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday were wounded.
Only Wyatt earp came through the fight unharmed.
The fight has come to represent a time in American history when the frontier थी open range for outlaws opposed by law enforcement that was spread thin over vast territories, leaving some areas unprotected.
The gunfight was नहीं well known to the American public until 1931 when author Stuart Lake published what has since been determined to be a largely fictionalized biography, Wyatt Earp : frontier Marshal, two सालो after Earp 's death.
Lake retold his story in a 1946 book कि director जॉन Ford developed into the movie My Darling Clementine.
After the movie Gunfight at the O.K. Corral was released in 1957, the shootout came to be known by that name.
Since then, the विरोध has been portrayed with varying degrees of accuracy in numerous Western films and books.
Despite its name, the gunfight दरअसल occurred in a narrow lot six doors west of the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral on Fremont Street, और also in the street.
The two opposing parties were initially only about apart.
About तीस shots were fired in thirty seconds.
Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday but they were आखिरकार exonerated by a local judge बाद a 30-day preliminary hearing and then again by a local grand jury.
On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was maimed in an assassination attempt by the outlaw Cowboys, and on March 18, 1882, they assassinated Morgan Earp.
The suspects furnished solid alibis, and newly appointed डिप्टी U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp took matters into his own hands during the Earp Vendetta Ride, ironically pursued by county Sheriff जॉनी Behan with warrants for the Earp 's arrest.
HDMI ( High-Definition Multimedia Interface ) is a compact audio/video interface लिये transferring uncompressed video data and compressed/uncompressed digital audio data from a HDMI-compliant device ( `` the सोर्स device '' ) to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device.
HDMI is a digital replacement for existing analog video standards.
There are a number of HDMI-standard cable connectors available, each of which can be used for any uncompressed TV or PC video स्वरूप, including standard, enhanced, high definition, and 3D video signals ; up to 8 channels of compressed or uncompressed digital audio ; a CEC ( Consumer Electronics Control ) connection ; and an Ethernet आंकड़ा connection.
HDMI implements the EIA/CEA-861 standards, which define वीडियो formats and waveforms, transport of compressed, uncompressed, and LPCM audio, auxiliary data, और implementations of the VESA EDID.
The cec allows hdmi devices to control each other when necessary and allows the उपयोक्ता to operate multiple devices with one remote कंट्रोल हैंडसेट.
Because HDMI is electrically compatible with the CEA-861 signals used by digital visual interface ( DVI ), no signal conversion is necessary, nor is वहीँ a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used.
As an uncompressed CEA-861 connection, HDMI is independent of the various digital टेलीविज़न standards used by individual devices, such as ATSC and DVB, as these are encapsulations of compressed MPEG video स्ट्रीम ( which can be decoded and output as an uncompressed video stream on HDMI ).
Production of consumer HDMI उत्पाद started in late 2003.
In Europe either DVI-HDCP or HDMI is included in the HD ready in-store labeling specification for TV sets for HDTV, formulated by EICTA with SES Astra in 2005.
HDMI began to appear on consumer HDTV camcorders and डिजिटल still cameras in 2006.
as of January 8, 2013, which is ten years after the release of the first HDMI specification, over 3 billion hdmi devices have shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard.

Defibrillation consists of delivering a therapeutic खुराक of electrical energy to the affected heart with a device called a defibrillator.
This depolarizes a critical mass of the heart muscle, terminates the dysrhythmia, and allows normal sinus rhythm to be reestablished by the देह 's natural pacemaker, in the sinoatrial node of the heart.
Defibrillators can be external, transvenous, or implanted, depending on the type of device used or needed.
Some external units, known as automated external defibrillators ( AEDs ), automate the diagnosis of treatable rhythms, meaning कि lay responders or bystanders are able to use them successfully साथ little, or in some cases no training at all.

Ancient history is the study of the written past from the beginning of recorded human history to the Early Middle Ages.
The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 years, with Cuneiform स्क्रिप्ट, the oldest discovered form of coherent writing, from the protoliterate period around the 30th century BC.
This is the beginning of history, as opposed to prehistory, according to the definition used by most historians.
The term classical antiquity is प्रायः used to refer to history in the Old World from the beginning of recorded Greek history in 776 bc ( First Olympiad ).
This roughly coincides with the परंपरागत date of the founding of Rome in 753 bc, the beginning of the history of ancient Rome, और the शुरूआत of the Archaic period in Ancient Greece.
Although the ending date of ancient history is disputed, some Western scholars use the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, the closure of the Platonic Academy in 529 AD, the death of the emperor Justinian I, the coming of Islam or the rise of Charlemagne as the end of ancient and Classical European history.

Methylcobalamin ( shown ) is a form of विटामिन B12.
Physically it resembles the other forms of vitamin B12, occurring as अंधेरा red crystals that freely form cherry-colored transparent solutions in water.
Vitamin B12, vitamin B12 or vitamin B-12, also called cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin with a कुंजी role in the सामान्य कामकाज of the brain and nervous system, and for the formation of blood.
It is one of the आठ B vitamins.
It is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human देह, especially affecting DNA संश्लेषण और regulation, but also fatty acid synthesis and energy production.
Neither fungi, plants, nor animals are capable of producing vitamin b12.
Only bacteria and archaea have the enzymes required for its synthesis, although अनेक भोजन हैं a natural source of B12 क्युकी of bacterial symbiosis.
The vitamin is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin and can be produced industrially तभी through bacterial fermentation-synthesis.
विटामिन B12 consists of a class of chemically related compounds ( vitamers ), all of which have vitamin activity.
It contains the biochemically rare element cobalt.
Biosynthesis of the basic structure of the vitamin is accomplished only by bacteria ( which usually produce hydroxocobalamin ), but conversion between different forms of the vitamin can be accomplished in the इंसान body.
A common semi-synthetic form of the vitamin, cyanocobalamin, does not occur in nature, but is produced from bacterial hydroxocobalamin and then used in many pharmaceuticals and supplements, and as a food additive, because of its stability and lower production cost.
In the body it is converted to the इंसान physiological forms methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, leaving behind the cyanide, albeit in minimal concentration.
More recently, hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin can be found in more expensive pharmacological products and food supplements.
The extra utility of ये is currently debated.
विटामिन B12 was discovered from its relationship to the disease pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disease in which parietal cells of the stomach responsible लिये secreting intrinsic factor are destroyed.
Intrinsic factor is crucial for the सामान्य absorption of B12, so a lack of intrinsic factor, as seen in pernicious anemia, causes a vitamin B12 deficiency.
Many other subtler kinds of vitamin B12 deficiency and their biochemical effects have since been elucidated.
The Roman Empire ( ) was the post- Republican period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterised by an autocratic form of सरकारी and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean in Europe, Africa, and Asia.
The 500-year-old Roman Republic, which preceded it, था been destabilized through a series of civil wars.
Several events marked the transition from Republic to Empire, including Julius Caesar 's appointment as perpetual dictator ( 44 BC ) ; the Battle of Actium ( 31 BC ) ; and the granting of the honorific Augustus to Octavian by the Roman Senate ( 27 BC ).
The first two centuries of the साम्राज्य were a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( `` Roman Peace '' ).
It पहुँचे its greatest expanse during the reign of त्राजान ( 98–117 AD ).
In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a संकट that threatened its existence, but was reunified and stabilized under the emperors Aurelian and Diocletian.

Total body surface area ( tbsa ) is an assessment measure of burns of the skin.
In adults, the `` rule of nines '' is used to determine the total percentage of area burned for प्रत्येक major section of the body.
In some cases, the burns may cover more than one body part, or may not fully cover such a part ; in these cases, burns are measured by using the casualty 's palm as a reference point for 1 % of the body.
For children और infants, the Lund-Browder chart is used to assess the burned body surface area.
Different percentages are प्रयुक्त क्युकी the अनुपात of the combined surface area of the head and neck to the surface area of the limbs is typically larger in children than that of an adult.

This is a list of roots, suffixes, and prefixes used in medical terminology, their meanings, and their etymology.
There are a few rules when using medical roots.
Firstly, prefixes and suffixes, primarily in यूनानी, लकिन भी in Latin, have a droppable -o-.
As a general rule, this -o- almost always acts as a joint-stem to connect two consonantal roots, e.g. arthr- + -o- + logy = arthrology.
But generally, the -o- is dropped when connecting to a vowel-stem ; e.g. arthr- + itis = arthritis, instead of arthr-o-itis.
Secondly, चिकित्सा roots generally go together according to language : Greek prefixes go with Greek suffixes and लैटिन prefixes with Latin suffixes.
Although international scientific vocabulary is not stringent about segregating combining फ़ॉर्म of different languages, it is advisable when coining new words not to mix different lingual roots.

Berliners watching a c-54 land at Tempelhof Airport ( 1948 )
The बर्लिन blockade ( 24 जून 1948 – 12 May 1949 ) was one of the पहला major international crises of the Cold War.
During the multinational occupation of post–world युद्ध II Germany, the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies ' railway, road, and canal access to the सेक्टर of Berlin under अलाइड control.
Their aim was to force the western powers to allow the Soviet मण्डल to start supplying Berlin with food and fuel, thereby giving the Soviets practical control over the entire city.
In response, the Western Allies व्यवस्थित the Berlin airlift to carry supplies to the people in West Berlin.
aircrews from the संयुक्त States Air Force, the British Royal Air Force, the royal Australian Air फ़ोर्स, the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal New जीलैंड Air Force, and the South African Air Force flew over 200,000 flights in one year, providing up to 4700 tons of daily necessities such as fuel and food to the Berliners.
By the spring of 1949, the effort थी clearly succeeding and, by April, the airlift was delivering अधिक cargo than had previously been transported into the city by rail.
The success of the Berlin Airlift brought embarrassment to the Soviets who had refused to believe it could make a अंतर.
The blockade was lifted in May 1949 and resulted in the creation of two पृथक German states.
The Federal Republic of Germany ( West Germany ) and the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) विभाजित up Berlin.
in स्मरण of the airlift, three airports in the former western zones of the city served as the primary gateways to Germany for another fifty years.

mate (, ; sometimes also spelled maté ), also known as chimarrão ( ) or cimarrón ( ), is a traditional South American infused drink, particularly in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and the दक्षिणी states of Brazil and to a lesser degree in south of Chile, the bolivian Chaco, Syria और Lebanon.
it is prepared from steeping dried leaves of yerba mate ( llex paraguariensis, known in Portuguese as erva-mate ) in hot water.
Mate is served with a metal straw from a shared hollow calabash gourd.
The straw is called a bombilla in some Latin American countries, a bomba in Portuguese, और a bombija or, more generally, a masassa ( प्रकार of straw ) in Arabic.
The straw is traditionally made of silver.
Modern, commercially available straws are typically made of nickel silver, called Alpaca ; stainless steel, or hollow-stemmed cane.
The gourd is known as a mate or a guampa ; while in Brazil, it has the specific name of cuia, or भी cabaça ( the name for Indigenous-influenced calabash gourds in other regions of Brazil, still used for general food और drink in रिमोट regions ).
Even if the जल is supplied from a modern thermos, the infusion is traditionally drunk from mates or cuias.
As with other brewed herbs, yerba mate leaves हैं dried, chopped, and मैदान into a powdery mixture called yerba.
The bombilla acts as both a straw and a sieve.
The submerged end is flared, with small छेद or स्लॉट that allow the brewed liquid in, but block the chunky matter that makes up much of the mixture.
A modern bombilla design uses a straight tube with holes, or spring sleeve to act as a sieve.
`` Tea-bag '' type infusions of mate ( mate cocido ) have been on the market in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay for अनेक years अंतर्गत such trade names as `` Taragüí Vitality '' in Argentina, `` Pajarito '' and `` Kurupí '' in Paraguay, and in Brazil under the name `` Mate leão ''.

Sydney Harbour from the air, showing the Opera House, the CBD, Circular Quay, the Bridge, the Parramatta River, North Sydney and Kirribilli in the foreground
The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel through arch सेतु across Sydney Harbour that carries rail, vehicular, bicycle और pedestrian traffic between the Sydney central business ज़िला ( CBD ) and the उत्तर Shore.
The dramatic view of the सेतु, the harbour, and the nearby सिडनी Opera House is an iconic image of Sydney, New South Wales, and Australia.
The bridge is nicknamed `` the Coathanger '' because of its arch-based design.
Under the directions of Dr J.J.C. Bradfield of the NSW Department of Public Works, the bridge was designed and built by British firm Dorman long and Co Ltd of middlesbrough and opened in 1932.
The सेतु 's design was influenced by the Hell Gate Bridge in New यॉर्क.
it was the world 's widest long-span bridge, at 48.8 meters ( 160 feet ) wide, until construction of the नई Port Mann Bridge in Vancouver.
It is also the fifth longest spanning-arch bridge in the संसार, and it is the tallest steel arch bridge, measuring from top to water level.
Until 1967 the harbour Bridge was Sydney 's tallest structure.
The Hawaii hotspot is a volcanic हॉटस्पॉट located near the namesake Hawaiian Islands, in the northern Pacific Ocean.
One of the most well-known and heavily studied hotspots in the world, the Hawaii plume is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, an over 5,800 kilometres ( 3,600 mi ) long chain of volcanoes, four of which are active, two of which are dormant, और more than 123 of which are extinct, many having since been मैदान beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls.
The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaii to the edge of the Aleutian Trench, near the eastern edge of Russia.
While most volcanoes हैं created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries, the Hawaii hotspot is located far from nearby plate boundaries ; the classic hotspot theory, first proposed in 1963 by John tuzo Wilson, proposes that a single, fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then, cut बंद from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate, become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years.
According to this theory, the nearly 60° bend separating the Emperor और Hawaiian segments of the chain was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate.
In 2003, fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory, suggesting that हॉटस्पॉट are mobile, not fixed, और that the 47 million year old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot 's motion rather than the plate 's.
Ancient Hawaiians were the first to recognize the increasing age और weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands.
The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea थी a major element in Hawaiian mythology, embodied in Pele, the deity of volcanoes.
After the arrival of europeans on the द्वीप, in 1880-1881 James Dwight Dana directed the पहला formal geological study of the hotspot 's volcanics, confirming the relationship long observed by the natives.
1912 marked the founding of the Hawaiian ज्वालामुखी Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation of the आइलैंड्स.
In the 1970s, a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaii 's seafloor.
The hotspot has since been tomographically imaged, showing it to be wide and up to deep, and olivine and garnet -based studies have shown its magma chamber is approximately.
in its at least 85 लाख सालो of activity the hotspot रै produced an estimated of rock.
the chain 's rate of drift रै slowly increased over time, causing the amount of time each individual volcano is active to decrease, from 18 million years for the 76 million year old Detroit Seamount, to बस under 900,000 for the एक million year-old Kohala ; on the अन्य हाथ, eruptive volume रै increased from per year to about.
Overall, this रै caused a trend towards more active लकिन quickly-silenced, closely spaced volcanoes—whereas volcanoes on the near side of the hotspot overlap each other ( forming such superstructures as Hawaii island and the प्राचीन Maui Nui ), the oldest of the सम्राट seamounts हैं spaced as far as apart.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw ( ONJ ) is a severe अस्थि disease that affects the maxilla and the mandible.
Various forms of ONJ have been described over the last 160 years, and a number of causes have been suggested in the literature.
Osteonecrosis of the jaws associated with bisphosphonate therapy, required by some cancer treatment regimens, रै been identified and defined as a pathological entity since 2003.
The possible risk from lower मौखिक doses of bisphosphonates, taken by patients to prevent or treat osteoporosis, remains uncertain.
विभिन्न treatment options have been explored, however severe मामले of ONJ still require surgical removal of the affected अस्थि.

Red Sox history has also been चिह्नित by the team 's intense rivalry with the New York यांकीज़, arguably the fiercest and सबसे historic in North American professional sports.
The Boston Red Sox are owned by Fenway Sports समूह, who भी own Liverpool Football क्लबों of the Premier League in England.
The Red Sox हैं consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road attendance, जबकि the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall attendance.

Polyethylene terephthalate ( sometimes written बहु ( ethylene terephthalate ) ), commonly abbreviated PET, PETE, or the obsolete PETP or PET-P, is a thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family and is प्रयुक्त in synthetic fibers ; पेय, food and other liquid containers ; thermoforming applications ; and engineering resins often in combination with glass fiber.
The term polyethylene terephthalate is a source of confusion because इस substance, PET, करता not contain polyethylene.
Thus, the alternate रूप, poly ( ethylene terephthalate ), is often used in scholarly journals for the sake of accuracy and clarity.
Depending on its processing and thermal history, polyethylene terephthalate may exist both as an amorphous ( पारदर्शी ) and as a semi-crystalline polymer.
The semicrystalline सामग्री might appear transparent ( particle size < 500 nm ) or अपारदर्शी and white ( particle size up to a few microns ) depending on its crystal structure and particle size.
Its monomer ( bis-β-hydroxyterephthalate ) can be synthesized by the esterification reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol with water as a byproduct, or by transesterification reaction between ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate with methanol as a byproduct.
Polymerization is through a polycondensation reaction of the monomers ( done immediately after esterification/transesterification ) with water as the byproduct.
The बहुमत of the world 's PET production is for synthetic fibers ( in excess of 60 % ), with bottle production accounting for around 30 % of global demand.
In the context of textile applications, PET is referred to by its common name, `` polyester, '' whereas the एक्रोनिम `` PET '' is generally used in relation to packaging.

A leasehold estate is an स्वामित्व of a temporary right to hold land or property in which a lessee or a tenant holds अधिकारों of real property by some form of title from a lessor or landlord.
Although a tenant does hold rights to रियल property, a leasehold estate is typically considered personal property.
Leasehold is a form of land tenure or property tenure where one party buys the सही to occupy land or a building for a given length of time.
As lease is a legal estate, leasehold estate can be खरीदा and sold on the open market.
A leasehold thus differs इससे a freehold or fee simple where the ownership of a प्रॉपर्टी is purchased outright and thereafter held for an indeterminate length of समय, and भी differs from a tenancy where a property is let ( rented ) on a periodic basis such as साप्ताहिक or monthly.
Until the end of the पट्टे period ( often measured in दशकों or सदियां ; a 99 year lease is quite common ) the leaseholder has the right to remain in occupation as an assured tenant paying an agreed rent to the owner.
Terms of the agreement are contained in a lease, which has elements of contract and property law intertwined.
The term estate for years may occasionally be used.
This refers to a leasehold estate for any specific period of time ( the word `` years '' is misleading ).

Gatun Lake was created to reduce the amount of work required for the canal.
The current locks are wide.
A third, wider lane of locks is being built.
France began work on the कनाल in 1881, but had to stop because of engineering problems and high mortality due to बीमारी.
The United States ( US ) later took over the project and took a decade to complete the canal in 1914, enabling जहाजों to avoid the lengthy Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America ( via the Drake Passage ) or to navigate the जलसन्धि of Magellan.
एक of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut made it possible for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in half the time previously required.
The shorter, faster, safer रूट to the US West Coast and to nations in and along the Pacific Ocean allowed those places to become more integrated साथ the world economy.
During this time, ownership of the territory that is now the Panama Canal was first Colombian, then French, and then American ; the United States completed the construction.
The canal was लिया over in 1999 by the Panamanian government, as long planned.
Annual traffic has risen इससे about 1,000 ships when the canal opened in 1914, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, the latter measuring a total of 309.6 लाख Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System ( PC/UMS ) tons.
by 2008, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal, many of them much larger than the original planners could have envisioned ; the largest ships that can transit the canal today are called Panamax.
The American Society of सिविल Engineers has named the Panama Canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world.

The nautical mile ( symbol M, NM or nmi ) is a unit of length that is about एक minute of arc of अक्षांश measured along any meridian, or about one minute of arc of longitude at the equator.
By international agreement it has been set at 1,852 मीटर exactly ( about 6,076 feet ).
It is a non- SI unit ( although accepted for use in the International System of Units by the BIPM ) used especially by navigators in the shipping and aviation industries, and also in polar exploration.
It is commonly used in international law and treaties, especially regarding the limits of territorial waters.
It developed from the sea mile and the related भौगोलिक mile.
The nautical mile remains in use by sea and air navigators worldwide because of its convenience when working with charts.
Most nautical चार्ट use the Mercator projection whose स्केल varies by about a factor of six from the equator to 80° अक्षांश, so charts covering large areas can not use a सिंगल linear scale.
The nautical mile is nearly equal to a minute of latitude on a चार्ट, so a distance measured with a chart divider can be roughly converted to nautical miles using the chart 's latitude scale.

The main components of a stamp:
1. Image
2. Perforations
3. Denomination
4. Country नाम
A postage स्टैम्प is a छोटी piece of paper that is खरीदा and displayed on an item of मेल as evidence of payment of postage.
Typically, stamps are made from special paper, with a national designation and denomination ( price ) on the face, and a gum adhesive on the रिवर्स पक्ष.
Postage stamps are purchased from a postal administration or other authorized vendor and are used to pay for the costs involved in moving mail as खूब as other business necessities such as बीमे and registration.
The stamp’s shape is usually that of a small rectangle of varying proportions, though triangles or अन्य shapes हैं occasionally used.
The stamp is affixed to an envelope or other postal cover ( i.e., packet, box, mailing cylinder ) कि the ग्राहक wishes to send.
the item is then processed by the postal system, where a postmark, sometimes known as a cancellation mark, is usually लागू over the stamp and cover ; this procedure marks the stamp as used, which prevents its reuse.
The postmark indicates the date and पाइंट of origin of the mailing.
The mailed item is then delivered to the address that the customer has applied to the envelope or cover.
Postage stamps have facilitated the delivery of mail चूंकि the 1840s.
Before this time, ink and hand-stamps ( hence the word 'stamp ' ), usually made इससे wood or cork, were often used to frank the mail and confirm the payment of postage.
The first adhesive postage stamp, commonly referred to as the Penny Black, was issued in the United Kingdom in 1840.
the invention of the stamp was a part of the attempt to reform and improve the postal system in the United Kingdom of ग्रेट Britain and Ireland, which in the early 19th century थी in disarray and rife with corruption.
There are varying accounts of the inventor or inventors of the स्टैम्प.
Before the introduction of postage stamps, mail in the UK was paid for by the recipient, a system कि was associated with an irresolvable प्रॉब्लम : the costs of delivering mail were not recoverable by the postal service when recipients were unable or unwilling to pay for delivered items, and senders had no incentive to restrict the number, आकार, or weight of items sent, whether or not they would ultimately be paid for.
The postage stamp resolved this समस्या in a simple और elegant manner, with the additional benefit of room for an element of beauty to be introduced.
Later related inventions include postal stationery such as prepaid-postage envelopes, post cards, lettercards, aerogrammes and wrappers, postage meters, and, more recently, specialty boxes and envelopes provided free to the customer by the U.S. postal service for priority or express mailing.
the postage stamp afforded convenience for both the mailer and postal officials, more efficiently recovered costs for the postal service, and ultimately resulted in a better, faster postal system.
With the conveniences stamps offered, their use resulted in greatly increased mailings दौरान the 19th and 20th सदियां.
Postage stamps दौरान this era were the most popular way of paying for mail, but by the end of the 20th century were rapidly होने eclipsed by the use of metered postage and bulk mailing by businesses. )
The same result with respect to communications by private parties occurred over the last decade of the 20th century and the first दशक of the 21st due to declining cost of long distance telephone communications and the विकास and explosive spread of electronic mailing ( `` e-mail '' via the Internet ) and bill paying systems था.
As postage stamps with their engraved imagery began to appear on a widespread basis, historians and collectors began to take notice.
The पढ़ाई of postage stamps और their उपयोग is referred to as philately.
Stamp collecting can be both a शौक and a form of historical study and reference, as government-issued postage stamps and their mailing systems have always महरूम involved with the history of nations.

One of Post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin 's most famous paintings.
The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.
It can also be expressed in different forms, such as `` Why हैं we here ? ``, `` What is life all परिचय ? ``, and `` What is the purpose of existence ? ''
It रै been the subject of much philosophical, scientific, and theological speculation throughout history.
There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.
The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, और happiness, and borders on many other issues, ऐसे as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple Gods, conceptions of परमेश्वर, the soul, and the afterlife.
Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how ' of जीवन.
Science भी studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being और a सम्बन्धित conception of morality.
An alternative, humanistic approach मुद्राएँ the question `` What is the meaning of my life ? ''
The value of the सवाल pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness, or even a feeling of sacredness.

`` The राजकुमारी and the मटर '' ( ; शाब्दिक translation : `` The Princess on the Pea '' ) is a literary परी tale by Hans Christian Andersen परिचय a young woman whose royal identity is established by a test of her physical sensitivity.
the tale was first published with three others by Andersen in an inexpensive booklet on 8 May 1835 in Copenhagen by C.A. Reitzel.
Andersen had heard the story as a चाइल्ड, and it likely has its source in folk material, possibly originating from स्वीडन as it is unknown in the Danish oral tradition.
Neither `` The Princess and the Pea '' nor Andersen 's other tales of 1835 were खूब received by Danish critics, who disliked their casual, chatty style, and their lack of morals.
In 1959 `` The Princess और the Pea '' was adapted to the musical stage in a production called Once Upon a Mattress starring Carol burnett.
German Americans ( ) हैं citizens of the United States who were either born in Germany or are of German ancestry.
They comprise about 50 million लोगों, making them the largest ancestry group ahead of Irish Americans, African Americans और English Americans.
They comprise about 1/3 of the German diaspora all over the world.
None of the German states had New World colonies.
Not until the 1670s did the first significant groups of German immigrants arrive in the British colonies, settling primarily in New York and Pennsylvania.
Immigration continued in very large numbers during the 19th century, with some eight million arrivals from Germany.
They were pulled by the attractions of land and धार्मिक freedom, and pushed out of Europe by shortages of land and religious or political oppression.
Many arrived seeking religious or political freedom, others for economic opportunities greater than those in Europe, and others simply for the chance to start fresh in the New World.
The arrivals before 1850 were mostly farmers who sought out the most productive land, where their intensive farming techniques would pay off.
After 1840, many came to शहरों, जहाँ `` Germania '' —German-speaking districts—soon emerged.
German Americans established the पहला kindergartens in the United राज्य, introduced the Christmas tree tradition, and originated popular American foods such as hot dogs and hamburgers.
German American celebrations are held throughout the country, one of the most well-known being the German-American Steuben Parade in New York City, held प्रत्येक third Saturday in सितंबर.
वहीँ हैं also major annual events in Chicago, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, St. Louis and other cities.
Like अनेक अन्य immigrants that आए to the United States, an overwhelming number of लोगों of German or partial German descent have essentially become Americanized.
The Preamble to the United राज्य Constitution is a brief introductory statement of the Constitution 's आधारभूत purposes and guiding principles.
It राज्य in general शर्तें, and न्यायालयों have referred to it as reliable evidence of, the Founding fathers ' intentions regarding the Constitution 's अर्थ and what they hoped the Constitution would achieve as it pertains to all of the people of the United States.
As the phrase, `` we the people '' suggests that the new government originates from the लोगों of the United States and it sets into motion a question as it pertains to that विशाल population concerning the individual rights and equality among all people ; इस can be seen most broadly in the divide between republicanism और social democracy.
The history of the Internet began with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s.
The public was first introduced to the concepts that would lead to the Internet when a message was sent over the ARPANet from computer विज्ञान प्राध्यापक Leonard kleinrock 's laboratory at University of California, Los एंजिल्स ( UCLA ), after the second piece of संजाल equipment was installed at Stanford Research Institute ( SRI ).
पैकेट switched networks such as ARPANET, Mark i at npl in the UK, CYCLADES, मेरिट Network, Tymnet, and Telenet, were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols.
The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking, in which multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks.
In 1982, the Internet protocol suite ( TCP/IP ) was standardized, और नतीजतन, the concept of a world-wide network of interconnected TCP/IP networks, called the Internet, was introduced.
Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National विज्ञान Foundation ( NSF ) developed the Computer Science Network ( CSNET ) and again in 1986 when NSFNET provided access to supercomputer sites in the United States from research and education organizations.
Commercial Internet service providers ( ISPs ) began to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990.
The Internet was commercialized in 1995 when NSFNET थी decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic.
Since the mid-1990s, the Internet has had a revolutionary impact on culture and commerce, including the rise of near-instant communication by इलेक्ट्रॉनिक mail, instant messaging, Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) `` phone calls '', two-way इंटरैक्टिव video calls, और the World Wide Web साथ its discussion forums, blogs, social networking, and online shopping sites.
The शोध and education community continues to develop and use advanced networks such as NSF 's very high speed Backbone Network Service ( vBNS ), Internet2, and National LambdaRail.
Increasing amounts of आंकड़ा are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s, 10-Gbit/s, or more.
The Internet 's takeover over the global communication landscape was almost instant in historical terms : it only communicated 1 % of the सूचना flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the साल 1993, already 51 % by 2000, and more than 97 % of the telecommunicated information by 2007.
आज the Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information, commerce, entertainment, and social networking.

Benedict XVI (,, ; born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger on 16 April 1927 ) is Pope emeritus of the Catholic Church.
He served as Pope from 2005 to 2013.
In that position, he was both the leader of the Catholic Church और Sovereign of the Vatican City State.
Benedict was elected on 19 April 2005 in a papal conclave, celebrated his Papal Inauguration द्रव्यमान on 24 April 2005, and took possession of his cathedral, the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, on 7 May 2005.
Ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria, Ratzinger established खुद as a highly regarded university theologian by the late 1950s and was appointed a full professor in 1958.
After a long career as an academic, serving as a professor of theology at several German universities—the last being the University of Regensburg, where he served as Vice अध्यक्ष of the university in 1976 and 1977—he थी नियुक्त Archbishop of Munich and freising and कार्डिनल by Pope Paul VI in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little लुभावने experience.
In 1981, he settled in Rome when he became Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia.
From 2002 जबतक his election as pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals, and as such, the primus inter pares among the cardinals.
Prior to becoming pope, he was `` a major figure on the वेटिकन stage for a quarter of a century '' as `` one of the most respected, influential और controversial members of the College of Cardinals '' ; he had an influence `` second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions '' as one of Pope John Paul II 's closest confidants.
He was originally a liberal theologian, but adopted conservative views after 1968.
His prolific writings defend traditional Catholic doctrine and values.
During his papacy, Benedict XVI advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries.
he views relativism 's denial of objective truth, and the denial of moral truths in particular, as the central problem of the 21st century.
He taught the महत्व of both the Catholic Church and an understanding of God 's redemptive प्रेम.
Pope Benedict also revived a number of traditions including elevating the Tridentine Mass to a more prominent स्थिति.
He renewed the relationship between the Catholic Church and art, viewing the use of सौंदर्य as a path to the sacred, प्रचारित the use of Latin, और reintroduced traditional papal garments, लिये which reason he was called `` the pope of aesthetics ''.
He has been described as `` the main intellectual force in the Church '' since the mid-1980s.
अनेक of Pope Benedict 's students from his academic career are also prominent churchmen today and confidantes of him, notably क्रिस्टोफ Schönborn.
On 11 February 2013, Pope Benedict announced his इस्तीफा in a speech in Latin before the cardinals, citing a `` lack of strength of mind and body '' due to his advanced age.
His resignation became effective on 28 February 2013.
He is the first pope to resign since Pope Gregory XII in 1415, और the first to do so on his own initiative since Pope Celestine V in 1294.
As पोप emeritus, Benedict retains the style of His Holiness, and the title of Pope, and will continue to dress in the papal रंग of white.
He was succeeded by Pope Francis on 13 March 2013, and he moved into the newly renovated Mater Ecclesiae monastery for his retirement on 2 May 2013..

a very early depiction of people using a stereoscope.
stereoscopy ( also called stereoscopics or 3D imaging ) is a technique लिये बनाना or enhancing the illusion of depth in an image by means of stereopsis for binocular vision.
The word stereoscopy derives from the यूनानी `` στερεός '' ( stereos ), `` कड़, solid '' + `` σκοπέω '' ( skopeō ), `` to dekh '', `` to see ''.
Most stereoscopic विधि present two offset images separately to the left and right eye of the viewer.
These two-dimensional images are तब combined in the brain to दे the perception of 3D depth.
This technique is distinguished from 3D displays that display an image in three full dimensions, allowing the observer to increase information about the 3-dimensional objects being displayed by सिर and eye movements.
John Adams ( October 30, 1735 ( O.S. October 19, 1735 ) – July 4, 1826 ) was the second president of the United States ( 1797–1801 ), having earlier served as the first vice president of the United States.
an American Founding Father, he was a statesman, diplomat, and a leading advocate of अमरीकी independence from Great Britain.
Well educated, he was an Enlightenment political theorist जो promoted republicanism and लिखा prolifically about his often seminal ideas, both in published works and in letters to his wife and कुंजी adviser Abigail as well as to other Founding Fathers.
Adams came to prominence in the जल्दी stages of the American Revolution.
A lawyer and public figure in Boston, as a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress, he played a leading role in persuading Congress to घोषित independence.
He assisted Thomas Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and was its primary advocate in the Congress.
Later, as a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with ग्रेट Britain, and was responsible for obtaining vital governmental loans from Amsterdam bankers.
A political theorist और historian, Adams largely wrote the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which together with his earlier Thoughts on Government, influenced American political thought.
One of his greatest roles was as a न्यायधीश of character : in 1775, he nominated George Washington to be commander-in-chief, and 25 years later nominated John Marshall to be Chief Justice of the United States.
Adams ' revolutionary credentials secured him two terms as George Washington 's vice president और his own election in 1796 as the second president.
During his one पद, he encountered ferocious attacks by the Jeffersonian republicans, as well as the dominant faction in his own Federalist Party led by his bitter enemy Alexander Hamilton.
Adams signed the controversial Alien and राजद्रोह Acts, and built up the army and navy especially in the face of an undeclared naval war ( called the `` Quasi-War `` ) with France, 1798–1800.
The प्रमुख accomplishment of उसके presidency was his peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton 's opposition.
In 1800, Adams was defeated for re-election by Thomas Jefferson and retired to Massachusetts.
He later resumed his friendship with Jefferson.
He and his wife, Abigail Adams, founded an accomplished family line of politicians, राजनयिकों, और historians now referred to as the एडम्स political family.
Adams was the father of John क्विंसी Adams, the छठे President of the United States.
His achievements have received greater recognition in modern times, though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of अन्य Founders.
Adams was the first U.S. president to reside in the building कि eventually became known as the White House.

A jetboat is a boat propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craft.
Unlike a powerboat or motorboat that uses a propeller in the water below or पीछे the boat, a jetboat draws the water इससे under the boat into a pump inside the boat, then expels it through a nozzle at the stern.
Jetboats were originally designed by Sir William हैमिल्टन ( जो developed a waterjet in 1954 ) for operation in the fast-flowing and उथले rivers of New Zealand, specifically to overcome the problem of propellers striking rocks in such waters.
Previous attempts at waterjet propulsion had very short lifetimes, generally due to the inefficient design of the units and the fact that they offered few advantages over conventional propellers.
Unlike these previous waterjet developments, such as Campini 's और the Hanley Hydrojet, Hamilton had a specific need for a propulsion system to operate in very-shallow water, and the waterjet proved to be the आदर्श solution.
From this, the popularity of the jet unit and jetboat increased rapidly.
Through further developments, it was found the waterjet offered several other advantages over propellers for a wide range of vessel types, and as such, waterjets are used widely today for many high-speed vessels, including यात्री ferries, rescue craft, patrol नौकाएँ and offshore supply vessels.
jetboats हैं highly maneuverable, and many can, from full speed, be reversed and brought to a stop within little more than their अपना length, in a maneuver known as a `` crash stop ''.
The खूब known Hamilton turn or `` jet spin '' is a high-speed maneuvre where the boat 's engine throttle is काटें, the परिचालन is turned sharply और the throttle opened again, causing the boat to spin जल्दी around with a large spray of water.
There is no अभियान्त्रिकी limit to the size of jetboats, though the validity of their use depends a lot on the type of application.
Classic prop-drives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds, up to about, but as boat speed increases beyond this, the extra hull resistance generated by struts, rudders, shafts ( etc. ) means waterjets हैं more efficient in the 20-50 knot range ( up to ).
Also, in situations with very large propellers turning at slow speeds ( such as tug boats ), the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical.
For these reasons, the विशाल बहुमत of waterjet units are installed in high-speed vessels and in particular situations where shallow draught, maneuverability, and load flexibility are main concerns.
The biggest jet-driven vessels are found in military use or the high-speed passenger/car ferry industry.
South Africa 's s ( approximately long ) are the biggest jet-propelled vessels so far.
Even these German-built vessels are capable of performing `` crash stops ''.
uveitis is broadly defined as सूजन of the uvea.
The uvea consists of the middle, pigmented, vascular structures of the eye and includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid.
Uveitis requires an urgent referral and thorough examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist along with urgent treatment to control the सूजन.

The Shining is a 1980 psychological हॉरर film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick, co-written with novelist Diane जॉनसन, and starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Scatman Crothers, and Danny Lloyd.
The film is based on the Stephen King novel the Shining.
A writer, Jack Torrance, takes a job as an off-season caretaker at an isolated hotel.
His young son possesses psychic abilities and is समर्थ to see things from the past and future, such as the ghosts who inhabit the hotel.
Soon after settling in, the परिवार is trapped in the होटल by a snowstorm, and Jack gradually becomes influenced by a supernatural presence ; he descends into madness and attempts to murder his wife and son.
Unlike previous kubrick films, which developed an audience gradually by building on word-of-mouth, The Shining थी released as a mass-market film, opening at पहला in just two cities on Memorial Day, then nationwide a month later.
Although initial जवाब to the film was mixed, later critical मूल्यांकन was more favorable and it is now viewed as a classic of the horror genre.
Film director Martin स्कोर्सेसे, writing in The Daily Beast, ranked it as one of the 11 scariest horror movies of all time.
Film critics, film students, and Kubrick 's producer, Jan Harlan, have remarked on the enormous influence the film has had on popular culture.
The initial European release of The Shining was 25 minutes shorter than the American संस्करण, achieved by removing सबसे of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel.
आँगन Cola Bottle
Patio Diet Cola was a brand of आहार soda introduced by Pepsi in 1963.
it was created in response to आहार Rite Cola, जिससे थी the first diet cola on the market.
Fitness promoter Debbie Drake थी Patio Diet Cola 's प्रवक्ता.
In 1964, Patio released orange, grape, and root beer flavors.
This flavor line was not meant to compete with brands like Orange Crush, but rather भरण out the line.
आँगन sodas were available in the cold-bottle market : grocery and mom-and-pop stores.
विज्ञापन for Patio was comparatively scarce ; at the time, bottlers were regionally franchised, and सम्बन्धित advertising was necessarily local.
In 1964, Patio diet cola became Diet Pepsi.
The newly branded diet soda was advertised alongside Pepsi with the tagline `` Pepsi either way '', जिससे replaced the slogan `` Dances with flavor ''.
The short life span of Patio Diet कोला makes it a great addition लिये bottle collectors.
Most of the remaining Patio line of जायका were phased out by the early 1970s, while a few survived until the मिड 70s
अवसंरचना is basic physical and organizational structures needed for the operation of a society or enterprise, or the services and facilities necessary लिये an economy to फलन.
It can be generally defined as the set of interconnected structural तत्व that provide framework supporting an entire structure of विकास.
It is an महत्वपूर्ण term for judging a country or region 's development.
The term typically refers to the technical structures that support a society, such as सड़कें, bridges, water supply, sewers, electrical ग्रिड, दूरसंचार, and so forth, and can be defined as `` the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions. ''
Viewed functionally, infrastructure facilitates the production of goods and services, and भी the distribution of finished products to markets, as well as basic social services such as schools and hospitals ; for example, roads enable the transport of कच्चा materials to a factory.
In military parlance, the term refers to the buildings and permanent संस्थापना necessary for the support, redeployment, and operation of military forces.
to make it simple, infrastructure is anything that is needed everyday, an everyday item.
A आलेखीय प्रतिनिधित्व of the ideal human karyotype
Mitochondrial DNA.
Human genetic variation is the genetic differences both within and among populations.
There may be multiple variants of कोई given gene in the human population ( genes ), leading to polymorphism.
Many genes are not polymorphic, meaning कि only a single allele is उपस्थित in the population : the gene is then said to be fixed.
No two humans are genetically identical.
Even monozygotic twins, who develop from one zygote, have infrequent genetic differences due to mutations occurring during विकास and gene copy number विभिन्नता.
Differences between individuals, even closely related individuals, are the key to techniques such as genetic fingerprinting.
Alleles occur at different frequencies in different human populations, with populations that are more geographically and ancestrally remote tending to differ more.
Causes of मतभेद between individuals include the exchange of genes during meiosis and various mutational events.
वहीँ are at least two reasons why genetic variation exists between populations.
Natural selection may confer an adaptive advantage to individuals in a specific environment if an allele provides a प्रतिस्पर्धी लाभ.
Alleles under selection are likely to occur only in those geographic regions where they confer an advantage.
The second main cause of genetic variation is due to the high degree of neutrality of most mutations.
Most mutations do not appear to have any selective effect one way or the other on the organism.
The main cause is genetic drift, this is the effect of यादृच्छिक changes in the gene pool.
In humans, founder effect and past small population size ( increasing the likelihood of genetic drift ) may have had an important influence in neutral differences between populations.
The theory that humans recently migrated out of Africa supports this.
The study of human genetic variation रै both evolutionary significance और medical applications.
It can help scientists understand ancient human population migrations as well as how different human groups are biologically related to one another.
For medicine, study of human genetic विभिन्नता may be important because some disease-causing alleles occur अधिक often in people from specific geographic regions.
New findings show that each human has on average 60 new mutations compared to their parents.
Apart from mutations, many genes that may have aided humans in ancient times plague humans today.
For example, it is suspected कि genes कि allow humans to more efficiently प्रक्रम food are those that make people susceptible to मोटापा and diabetes आज.
Tea Party protesters on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall at the Taxpayer कूच on वॉशिंगटन on September 12, 2009.
The Tea Party movement is an American political गति कि advocates strict adherence to the United States Constitution, reducing U.S. government spending and taxes, and reduction of the U.S. national debt and federal बजट deficit.
The movement रै been called partly conservative, partly libertarian, and partly populist.
The movement has sponsored विरोध और supported political candidates since 2009.
The name of the गति is derived इससे the Boston Tea Party of 1773, an iconic event in American history.
Anti-tax protesters in the United States have often referred to the original Boston Tea पार्टी for inspiration.
सन्दर्भ to the Boston Tea Party were part of Tax दिन protests held throughout the 1990s and पहले.
By 2001, a custom had developed among some रूढ़िवादी activists of mailing tea बैग to विधायक and other officials as a symbolic act.
The currencies of प्यूर्टो Rico closely follow the historic development of Puerto Rico.
As a colony of स्पेन and the United States, Puerto Rico was granted the use of both foreign and provincial currencies.
Following the Spanish colonization in 1502, Puerto रीको became an महत्वपूर्ण port, with its own supply of gold.
However, as the mineral reserves भागा empty within the century, the archipelago 's economy suffered.
The Spanish Crown जारी the Situado Mexicano, which meant that a semi-regular shipment of gold from the Viceroyalty of New Spain would be sent to the island, as a way to provide economic support.
Between 1636 and 1637, Philip IV of Spain imposed a tax which had to be paid using a revenue stamp.
Inspired by this, Puerto Rico began producing banknotes in 1766, बनने the first colony to print 8- real banknotes in the Spanish Empire and जिससे in the Spanish government 's स्वीकृति of subsequent issues.
The situado was discontinued दौरान the 19th century, creating an आर्थिक crisis, as a result of Mexico gaining its independence from Spain.
Salvador Meléndez Bruna, the colonial राज्यपाल in office, ordered the issue of provincial banknotes, creating the Puerto Rican peso.

He built on and greatly परिष्कृत earlier work on the causes of business cycles, and is widely considered to be एक of the founders of modern macroeconomics and the most influential economist of the 20th century.
His ideas are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics, as well as its various offshoots.
In many ways, subsequent developments in 20th century अर्थशास्त्र can be viewed as either building on keynes ' ideas or reacting against them.
In the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking, overturning the older ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets होता, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as मजदूर were flexible in their wage demands.
keynes instead argued that aggregate माँग determined the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of ऊँची unemployment.
He advocated the use of fiscal and monetary measures to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions और depressions.
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Keynes 's ideas concerning economic policy were adopted by leading Western economies.

Keynesian economics provided the सैद्धांतिक underpinning लिये आर्थिक policies undertaken in response to the crisis by Presidents George W. Bush and बराक Obama of the संयुक्त States, Prime Minister गॉर्डन Brown of the United Kingdom, and other heads of governments.
In 1999, Time magazine included Keynes in their list of the 100 सबसे important and influential people of the 20th सदी, commenting that : `` His radical idea that governments should spend money they do n't have may have saved capitalism. ''
In addition to being an economist, keynes was also a civil servant, a director of the British Eugenics Society, a director of the बैंको of इंग्लैण्ड, a patron of the arts and an art collector, a part of the Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals, an advisor to several charitable trusts, a writer, a philosopher, a private investor, and a farmer.

In Greek mythology, the Trojan War was waged विरूद्ध the city of Troy by the Achaeans ( Greeks ) after पेरिस of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus किंग of Sparta.
The war is one of the सबसे महत्वपूर्ण events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through अनेक works of यूनानी literature, most notably through Homer 's Iliad and the Odyssey.
The Iliad relates a part of the last year of the siege of Troy ; the Odyssey describes Odysseus 's journey home.
Other parts of the war are contained in a cycle of epic poems, which have survived through fragments.
Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature, and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid.
The war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses Athena, Hera, और Aphrodite, after Eris, the goddess of strife and अनबन, दिया them a golden apple, sometimes known as the Apple of Discord, marked `` for the fairest ''.
Zeus sent the goddesses to Paris, who judged that Aphrodite, as the `` fairest '', चाहिए receive the apple.
In exchange, Aphrodite made Helen, the most beautiful of all women and wife of Menelaus, fall in प्रेम with Paris, who took her to Troy.
Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and the brother of Helen 's husband Menelaus, led an expedition of Achaean troops to Troy and besieged the city लिये ten years because of Paris ' insult.
After the deaths of many heroes, including the Achaeans Achilles and Ajax, and the Trojans Hector and Paris, the city fell to the ruse of the Trojan Horse.
The achaeans slaughtered the Trojans ( except for some of the women and children whom वे kept or sold as slaves ) and desecrated the temples, thus earning the gods ' wrath.
few of the Achaeans returned safely to their homes and many founded colonies in distant shores.
The Romans later traced their origin to Aeneas, one of the Trojans, who was said to have led the surviving Trojans to modern-day Italy.
The ancient Greeks thought that the Trojan War was a ऐतिहासिक event that had taken place in the 13th or 12th century BC, और believed that Troy was located in modern-day Turkey near the Dardanelles.
by modern times, both the war और the city were widely believed to be non-historical.
In 1868, however, the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann met Frank Calvert, who convinced Schliemann that Troy was at Hissarlik and Schliemann took over calvert 's excavations on property belonging to Calvert ; this claim is now accepted by most scholars.
Whether there is any historical reality behind the Trojan War is an open question.
Many scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale, though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and रिझाने by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age.
Those who believe that the stories of the Trojan War are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th सदियां BC, often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes, 1194–1184 BC, जिससे roughly corresponds with पुरातत्व evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VIIa.

Passover, or Pesach ( from : in Hebrew, Yiddish ), Tiberian :, Modern Hebrew : /ˈpesaχ/ Pesah, Pesakh, Yiddish : Peysekh, paysakh, Paysokh ) is an important Biblically -derived Jewish पर्व.
historically, together with Shavuot ( `` Pentecost '' ) and Sukkot ( `` Tabernacles '' ), Passover is one of the three pilgrimage festivals ( Shalosh Regalim ) during which the entire जनसांख्यिकी of the kingdom of Judah made a pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem.
Samaritans still make this pilgrimage to Mount gerizim, but only men participate in public worship.
Passover commences on the 15th of the Hebrew month of Nisan and lasts for either seven days ( in Israel ) or eight days ( in the diaspora ).
In Judaism, a day commences at dusk और lasts until the following dusk, यूँ the first day of Passover only begins after dusk of the 14th of Nisan and ends at dusk of the 15th दिन of the month of Nisan.
The rituals unique to the Passover celebrations commence with the Passover seder when the 15th of Nisan रै begun.
in the उत्तरी Hemisphere Passover takes place in spring as the Torah prescribes it : `` in the month of [ the ] spring '' ( בחדש האביב ).
It is one of the सबसे widely observed Jewish holidays.
The यहूदी people celebrate Passover as a commemoration of their liberation over 3,300 years ago by God from slavery in ancient Egypt that was ruled by the Pharaohs, and their birth as a nation under the नेतृत्व of Moses.
It commemorates the story of the Exodus as described in the यहूदी Bible especially in the Book of exodus, in जिससे the Israelites were freed इससे slavery in Egypt.
In the narrative of the Exodus, the Bible tells that God helped the Children of Israel escape from their slavery in Egypt by inflicting ten plagues upon the ancient Egyptians पहले the Pharaoh would release उसके Israelite slaves ; the दसवाँ and worst of the plagues थी the death of the Egyptian first-born.
The Israelites were instructed to चिह्नित the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a slaughtered spring lamb and, upon seeing this, the spirit of the Lord knew to pass over the first-born in these homes, hence the name of the अवकाश.
There is some debate over where the term is दरअसल derived from.
When the Pharaoh freed the Israelites, it is said that वे left in such a hurry कि they could not wait for bread dough to rise ( leaven ).
In commemoration, for the duration of Passover no leavened bread is eaten, for which reason it is called `` The Festival of the Unleavened Bread ''.
Thus Matzo ( flat unleavened bread ) is eaten during Passover and it is a symbol of the holiday.

Halley is the only short-period comet that is clearly visible to the naked eye इससे धरती, and thus the only naked-eye धूमकेतु कि might appear twice in a human lifetime.
Other naked-eye comets may be brighter और more spectacular, but will appear only once in हज़ारों of years.
Halley 's returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BCE.
Clear records of the comet 's appearances were made by Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European chroniclers, but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time.
The comet 's periodicity थी first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley, after whom it is now नामित.
Halley 's धूमकेतु last appeared in the inner Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061.
During its 1986 apparition, हैली became the first धूमकेतु to be observed in detail by spacecraft, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation.
These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, विशेषकर Fred Whipple 's `` dirty snowball '' model, which correctly predicted that Halley होता be रचित of a mixture of volatile ices – such as water, carbon डाइऑक्साइड and ammonia – and dust.
The missions also provided data which substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas ; for instance it is now understood that Halley 's surface is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and कि only a small portion of it is icy.

Later they kill the सांड of Heaven, which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning उसके advances.
as a punishment for these actions, the gods वाक्य enkidu to death.
The second half of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh 's distress at Enkidu 's death, and his quest for immortality.
In order to learn the रहस्य of eternal जीवन, Gilgamesh undertakes a long and perilous journey.
He learns that `` The life that you are seeking you will never ढूँढें.
When the gods created man they allotted to him death, but जीवन they retained in their own keeping. ''
This quote थी originally attributed to Siduri in the Old Babylonian version of the epic, and तब attributed to the immortal flood hero Utnapishtim in the Akkadian संस्करण of the epic.

Data Execution Prevention ( DEP ) is a security विशेषता included in modern operating systems.
It is ज्ञात to be available in Linux, Mac OS X, आईओएस, Microsoft Windows and Android operating प्रणालियों and is intended to prevent an application or service from executing code from a non-executable memory region.
This helps prevent certain exploits that store code via a buffer overflow, for example.
DEP runs in two modes : hardware-enforced DEP लिये CPUs that can mark memory pages as nonexecutable, and software-enforced DEP with सीमित protection for CPUs that do not have hardware support.
Software-enforced DEP does not protect against निष्पादन of code in data pages, लकिन instead counters SEH overwrite, another type of attack.
DEP was introduced on Linux in 2004 ( kernel 2.6.8 ), on Windows in 2004 with Windows XP Service Pack 2, while Apple introduced DEP when they moved to x86 in 2006.

Early CAPTCHAs such as these, generated by the EZ-Gimpy कार्यक्रम, यहूद used on Yahoo !
A modern CAPTCHA, rather than attempting to create a distorted background and high levels of warping on the text, might फ़ोकस on बनाना segmentation difficult by adding an angled line.
another way to make segmentation difficult is to crowd symbols together, as in Yahoo ! 's current CAPTCHA format.
Some CAPTCHAs try to utilize the ability of people to see three-dimensional objects.
On this image, symbols are drawn with lines of different मोटाई to make an effect of extrusion.
a captcha ( ) is a type of challenge-response test used in computing as an attempt to ensure कि the response is generated by a human being.
The process usually involves a computer asking a user to complete a सरल test which the computer is able to grade.
These tests are designed to be easy for a computer to generate but difficult for a computer to solve, but again easy for a human.
If a correct समाधान is received, it can be presumed to have been entered by a human.
A common type of CAPTCHA requires the user to type letters and/or digits from a distorted image that appears on the screen.
Such tests are commonly used to prevent unwanted internet bots from accessing websites, चूंकि a normal human can easily read a CAPTCHA, while the bot can not process the image letters and therefore, can not answer properly, or at all.
Although most CAPTCHAs are letter pictures randomly generated, many of them have become difficult भी for a human to read, so picture CAPTCHAs were created in जिससे a human is shown a simple test to show a picture of a certain animal ( given few एनिमल pictures ), जिससे is simple for a human being to process, and therefore आसान to pick, जबकि a bot can not process and solve the question because although it can analyze the picture, it can not easily guess the animal.
The term `` CAPTCHA '' was coined in 2000 by Luis von ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper, and John Langford ( all of Carnegie Mellon University ).
It is an acronym based on the word `` capture '' and standing for `` Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart ''.
Carnegie Mellon University attempted to trademark the term on 15 October 2004, but the trademark application was abandoned on 21 अप्रैल 2008.
a CAPTCHA is sometimes described as a reverse Turing test, because it is administered by a machine and targeted at a human, in contrast to the standard Turing परीक्षण कि is typically administered by a human and targeted at a machine.

KFC ( केंटकी Fried Chicken ) is a fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, जिससे specializes in fried chicken.
An `` American icon '', it is the world 's second largest restaurant chain overall ( as measured by sales ) after McDonald 's, with over 18,000 outlets in 120 देशों and territories.
The company is a subsidiary of Yum !
Brands, a restaurant company which also owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
KFC was founded by Harland Sanders, who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky during the Great Depression.
सैंडर्स was one of the first people to see the potential of the restaurant franchising concept, with the first `` Kentucky Fried Chicken '' franchise opening in Utah in 1952.
The franchise popularized chicken in the fast खाना industry, thereby diversifying the market and challenging the dominance of the hamburger.
Marketing himself as `` Colonel सैंडर्स '', he became a legendary figure of American cultural history, and his image is still prominently used in KFC ब्रांडिंग.
The company 's rapid expansion saw it grow too large for Sanders to manage, and in 1964 he sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown, Jr. and Jack Massey.
KFC was one of the first तेज़ खाना chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in England, Mexico and Puerto Rico by the mid-1960s.
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, KFC experienced mixed सौभाग्य domestically, as it went through a series of corporate owners who had little or no experience in the restaurant business.
In the early 1970s, KFC थी बेची to the spirits firm Heublein, who were taken over by the R.J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate, who sold the chain to PepsiCo.
The chain continued to expand overseas however, and in 1987 KFC became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China.
The chain रै since expanded rapidly in China, and the देश is now the company 's most लाभप्रद market.
पेप्सिको spun off इसके रेस्तरां division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its नाम to Yum !
Brands.
KFC primarily sells fried मुर्गा pieces और variations such as chicken sandwiches and wraps, salads and side dishes such as फ्रेंच fries and coleslaw, desserts and soft drinks, often supplied by PepsiCo.
Its सबसे famous product is pressure fried chicken pieces, seasoned with Sanders ' `` Original Recipe '' of 11 herbs and spices.
The सटीक प्रकृति of these ingredients is अनजान, and represents a notable trade secret.
Larger portions of fried chicken are परोसा in a distinctive cardboard `` bucket '', which has become a signature of the chain since being introduced by वाल Pete Harman.

निडारिया ( with a silent c ) or Coelenterata is a phylum containing over 10,000 प्रजाति of animals found exclusively in aquatic and mostly marine environments.
Their distinguishing विशेषता is cnidocytes, specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey.
Their bodies consist of mesoglea, a non-living jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are ज़्यादातर एक cell thick.
They have two basic body forms : swimming medusae and sessile polyps, both of which हैं radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes.
Both forms have a single orifice and body गुहा that are used for digestion और respiration.
Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp-like zooids, or both.
Cnidarians ' activities हैं coordinated by a decentralized nerve net and simple receptors.
Several free-swimming cubozoa and Scyphozoa possess balance-sensing statocysts, and some have simple eyes.
Not all cnidarians reproduce sexually.
अनेक have complex lifecycles with asexual polyp stages and sexual medusae, but some omit either the polyp or the medusa stage.
Cnidarians were for a long time grouped with Ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla.
Cnidarians are classified into four main groups : the लगभग wholly sessile Anthozoa ( sea anemones, corals, sea pens ) ; swimming Scyphozoa ( जेलीफ़िश ) ; Cubozoa ( box jellies ) ; and Hydrozoa, a विविध group that शामिल all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, और has both sessile members such as Hydra और औपनिवेशिक swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o ' War.
Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their अपना right rather than a sub-group of scyphozoa, and there is बहस about whether Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa are cnidarians or closer to bilaterians ( अधिक complex animals ).
Most cnidarians prey on organisms ranging in size from plankton to animals several टाइम्स larger than themselves, but many obtain much of their nutrition from endosymbiotic algae, and a few are parasites.
Many are preyed upon by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish and turtles.
मूँगा reefs, whose polyps are rich in endosymbiotic algae, support कुछ of the world 's सबसे productive ecosystems, और protect vegetation in tidal zones and on shorelines from strong currents and tides.
While corals are लगभग entirely restricted to warm, shallow marine waters, other cnidarians live in the depths, in polar seas and in freshwater.
Fossil cnidarians have been found in rocks formed about, and other जीवाश्मों दिखाएँ that corals may have been present shortly before and diversified a few million years later.
Fossils of cnidarians that do not build mineralized structures are very rare.
Scientists currently सोचो that cnidarians, ctenophores and bilaterians हैं more closely related to calcareous sponges than these are to other sponges, and that anthozoans are the evolutionary `` aunts '' or `` sisters '' of other cnidarians, and the most closely related to bilaterians.
Recent analyses have concluded that cnidarians, although considered more `` primitive '' than bilaterians, have a wider range of genes.

एज़टेक cosmogram in the pre-Hispanic Codex Fejérváry-Mayer - the आग god Xiuhtecuhtli is in the center.
The Aztec people यहूद certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica इससे the 14th to 16th centuries.
The Nahuatl words aztecatl ( singular ) and aztecah ( plural ) औसत `` people from Aztlan ``, a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time, and later अपनाया as the word to define the Mexica people.
Often the term `` Aztec '' refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan ( now the location of Mexico City ), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as Mexica Tenochca or Cōlhuah Mexica.
Sometimes the term also includes the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan 's two principal allied city-states, the Acolhuas of Texcoco and the Tepanecs of Tlacopan, who together with the Mexica formed the Aztec ट्रिपल Alliance which controlled what is often known as `` the Aztec Empire ''.
In other contexts, Aztec may refer to all the various city states and their peoples, who shared large parts of उनके ethnic history and सांस्कृतिक traits with the Mexica, Acolhua और tepanecs, and who often also used the Nahuatl language as a lingua franca.
In इस meaning it is possible to talk about an Aztec civilization including all the particular cultural patterns आम for सबसे of the peoples inhabiting Central Mexico in the लेट postclassic period.
From the 13th century, the Valley of मैक्सिको was the heart of Aztec civilization : here the capital of the Aztec Triple Alliance, the नगर of tenochtitlan, was built upon raised islets in Lake Texcoco.
The Triple Alliance formed a tributary empire expanding its political hegemony far beyond the Valley of Mexico, conquering other city states throughout Mesoamerica.
At its pinnacle, Aztec culture had rich and complex mythological and religious परंपराओं, as well as reaching remarkable architectural and artistic accomplishments.
In 1521 Hernán Cortés, along with a large number of Nahuatl speaking indigenous allies, conquered Tenochtitlan and defeated the Aztec ट्रिपल Alliance under the leadership of Hueyi Tlatoani Moctezuma II.
Subsequently the Spanish founded the new settlement of Mexico City on the site of the ruined Aztec capital, from where they proceeded with the process of colonizing Central America.
Aztec culture and history is primarily known through archaeological evidence found in excavations such as that of the प्रसिद्ध Templo Mayor in Mexico City ; from indigenous bark paper codices ; from eyewitness accounts by Spanish conquistadors such as Hernán Cortés and Bernal Díaz del Castillo ; and especially from 16th and 17th सदी descriptions of Aztec culture and history written by Spanish clergymen and literate Aztecs in the Spanish or Nahuatl language, such as the famous Florentine Codex compiled by the Franciscan monk Bernardino de Sahagún with the help of indigenous Aztec informants.

A plot of a normal distribution ( or bell-shaped curve ) where each बैंड has a width of 1 standard deviation – See also : 68-95-99.7 rule
Cumulative probability of a normal distribution with expected value 0 and standard deviation 1.
In statistics and probability theory, standard deviation ( represented by the symbol sigma, σ ) shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average ( mean ), or expected मान.
A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean ; high standard विचलन indicates that the data points are spread आउट over a large range of मान.
The standard deviation of a random variable, statistical population, data set, or probability distribution is the square रूट of its variance.
It is algebraically simpler though practically less robust than the average absolute deviation.
A useful property of standard deviation is that, unlike variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data.
Note, however, that for measurements with percentage as unit, the standard विचलन will have percentage points as unit.
In addition to expressing the variability of a population, standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions.
For उदाहरण, the margin of error in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted अनेक टाइम्स.
The reported margin of error is typically about twice the standard deviation ­– the radius of a 95 percent confidence interval.
In science, researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data, and only effects that पतन far outside the range of standard deviation are considered statistically significant – normal यादृच्छिक error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from causal variation.
Standard deviation is also important in finance, where the मानक deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the volatility of the investment.
When only a sample of data from a population is available, the मानक विचलन of the population can be estimated by a modified quantity called the `` sample standard deviation ''.
When the नमूना is the entire population, its unmodified standard deviation is called the `` जनसांख्यिकी standard deviation ''.

Kennedy used his large, well-funded campaign organization to win the nomination, secure endorsements, and, with the aid of the last of the big-city bosses, to get out the vote in the big cities.
He relied on running mate Lyndon B. Johnson to hold the South and used television effectively.

The Rosetta Stone in the British Museum
The Rosetta Stone is an ancient Egyptian granodiorite stele inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis in 196 BC on behalf of King Ptolemy V.
The decree appears in three scripts : the upper text is Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the middle portion Demotic script, and the lowest Ancient Greek.
Because it presents essentially the same text in all three scripts ( साथ some minor differences between them ), it provided the key to the modern understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs.
Originally displayed within a temple, the stone was probably moved during the early Christian or medieval period and आखिरकार used as building material in the construction of फोर्ट Julien near the town of Rashid ( rosetta ) in the Nile Delta.
It was rediscovered there in 1799 by a सिपाही, Pierre-François Bouchard, of the French expedition to मिश्र.
As the first Ancient Egyptian दुभाषिया टेक्स्ट recovered in modern times, the Rosetta Stone aroused widespread public interest with इसके potential to decipher this hitherto untranslated प्राचीन language.
Lithographic copies and plaster casts began circulating among European museums and scholars.
Meanwhile, British सैनिकों defeated the French in Egypt in 1801, and the original stone came into British possession under the Capitulation of Alexandria.
Transported to London, it has been on public display at the British Museum since 1802.
It is the most-visited object in the British Museum.
Ever since इसके rediscovery, the stone has been the focus of nationalist rivalries, including its transfer from French to British possession during the Napoleonic Wars, a long-running dispute over the relative value of Young 's and Champollion 's योगदान to the decipherment, and since 2003, demands लिये the stone 's return to Egypt.
Study of the decree was already under way as the first full translation of the Greek text appeared in 1803.
It was 20 years, however, before the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by Jean-François Champollion in Paris in 1822 ; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and साहित्य confidently.
Major अग्रिम in the decoding were : recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text ( 1799 ) ; that the demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names ( 1802 ) ; that the hieroglyphic टेक्स्ट did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the demotic ( Thomas Young, 1814 ) ; and that, in addition to being used for विदेशी names, phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words ( champollion, 1822–1824 ).
Two other fragmentary नक़ल of the same डिक्री were discovered later, and several समान मिश्र bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including two slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees ( the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and the Memphis decree of Ptolemy IV, ca. 218 BC ).
The Rosetta Stone is इसलिए no longer अद्वितीय, but it was the essential key to modern understanding of Ancient Egyptian literature and civilization.
The term Rosetta Stone is now used in other contexts as the name for the essential clue to a new फ़ील्ड of knowledge.
Poison dart frog ( also dart-poison frog, poison frog or formerly poison arrow frog ) is the common name of a समूह of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to Central and South America.
These प्रजाति are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies.
हालांकि all wild dendrobatids are at least somewhat toxic, levels of toxicity vary considerably from one species to the next and from एक population to another.
Many प्रजाति are threatened.
ये amphibians are प्रायः called `` dart frogs '' due to the Amerindians ' indigenous use of their to poison the tips of blowdarts.
However, of over 175 species, only four have been documented as being used for this purpose ( curare plants are more commonly used ), all of which come from the Phyllobates genus, which is characterized by the relatively large size and ऊँची levels of toxicity of its members.
Cajeta is a मैक्सिकन confection of thickened सिरप usually made of sweetened caramelised milk.
according to chef Rick Bayless, the name for cajeta came from the Spanish phrase al punto de cajeta, which means `` a द्रव thickened to the point at which a चमचा drawn through the liquid reveals the bottom of the pot in which it is being cooked ''.
Another hypothesis is that it takes its name from the small wooden boxes in which it was traditionally packed.
Mexican cajeta is considered a specialty of the city of celaya in the state of Guanajuato, although it is also produced with the traditional method in several कस्बों of the state of jalisco, such as Mazamitla, Sayula, and Atotonilco el Alto.
Cajeta is made by simmering goat 's milk, or occasionally a sweetened liquid, stirring frequently, until it becomes very viscous due to evaporation of water, and caramelized.
While goat milk is the most usual base, other liquids or juices may be used.
in Celaya, and eventually the बाकी of Mexico, the confection of half goat 's milk and half cow 's milk became known by the name cajeta, but elsewhere, the milk candy became known as leche quemada, dulce de leche, etc.
It has cousins in the many Indian milk-based sweets like pera and the milk fudge burfi, and in the opera fudge of the U.S. Cajeta is खाया on its own as a sweet, as a स्प्रेड or filling for breads and pastries, such as churros, and as a topping for ice cream.
Certain liquors are added to special recipes पुकारा cajeta envinada.
In addition, cajeta envinada especial is enriched with raisins, almonds, pecans or nuts.
Often it is used as a topping for crêpes, as a sweet sauce boiled and softened down with milk to soak the crepes, resulting in a tasty dessert.
In Mexico many brands make cajeta but the most आम brand is Coronado.
It is भी very common to place cajeta between obleas to make a traditional Mexican dessert.

Cross-cultural psychology is the scientific study of human behavior and mental processes, including both their variability and invariance, under diverse cultural conditions.
Through expanding research methodologies to recognize cultural variance in behavior, language, and meaning it seeks to extend and develop psychology.
Since मनोविज्ञान as an academic discipline was developed largely in North America, some psychologists became concerned कि constructs accepted as universal were नहीं as invariant as previously assumed, especially since many attempts to replicate notable experiments in other cultures had varying success.
Since there are questions as to whether theories dealing with central विषयवस्तु, such as affect, cognition, conceptions of the self, and issues such as psychopathology, anxiety, and depression, may lack external validity जब `` exported '' to अन्य cultural contexts, cross-cultural psychology re-examines them using methodologies designed to factor in cultural differences so as to account for cultural variance.
Although some critics have pointed to methodological flaws in cross-cultural psychological research and claim that serious shortcomings in the theoretical and methodological bases used impede rather than सहायता the scientific search लिये universal principles in psychology, cross-cultural psychologists are turning more to the पढ़ाई of कैसा differences ( variance ) occur, rather than searching लिये universals in the style of physics or chemistry.
in 1972 the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology ( IACCP ) was established.
This branch of psychology has continued to expand as there has महरूम an increasing popularity of incorporating culture and diversity into अध्ययन.
Cross-cultural psychology is differentiated from Cultural psychology.
The latter is the branch of psychology that holds कि human बर्ताव is significantly influenced by cultural differences, meaning that psychological phenomena can only be compared with each other across cultures to a very limited extent.
In कंट्रास्ट, cross-cultural मनोविज्ञान includes a search for संभावित universals in behavior and दिमागी processes.

Non-binding arbitration is a type of arbitration in which the arbitrator makes a determination of the rights of the parties to the dispute, but this determination is not binding upon उन्हें, and no enforceable arbitration award is issued.
The `` award '' is in effect an advisory राय of the arbitrator 's view of the respective merits of the parties cases.
Non-binding arbitration is used in connection with attempts to reach a negotiated settlement.
The role of an arbitrator in non-binding arbitration is, on the सतह, similar to that of a mediator in a mediation.
however, the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle मैदान to compromise at, the arbitrator remains totally removed from the settlement process और will only give a determination of liability and, if appropriate, an indication of the quantum of damages payable.
Subsequent to a non-binding मध्यस्थता, the parties remain free to pursue their claims either through the courts, or by way of a binding arbitration, हालांकि in practice a settlement is the most common outcome.
The award and reasoning in a non-binding arbitration is almost invariably inadmissible in any subsequent action in the courts or in another arbitration tribunal.
Non-binding arbitration is utilised mostly in the United States and Canada.
It is largely अनजान in Europe, although in the United Kingdom there is a practice of parties who are seeking a settlement to jointly instruct a Queen 's Counsel for an opinion on the merits and likely क्वांटम of a claim, and then to negotiate on the basis of the views expressed in that opinion.

On the Origin of Species, published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the न्यास of evolutionary biology.
Its full title was on the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.
For the sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to The Origin of Species.
Darwin 's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection.
It presented a body of प्रमाण that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution.
Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.
Various evolutionary ideas had already been प्रस्तावित to explain new findings in biology.
There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists और the general पब्लिक, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the गिरिजाघर of England, while विज्ञान was भाग of प्राकृतिक theology.
Ideas about the transmutation of प्रजाति were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals.
The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.
The book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its प्रकाशन.
As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion.
the बहस over the book contributed to the campaign by T.H. Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism.
Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching पैटर्न of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate.
During the `` eclipse of Darwinism `` from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit.
With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin 's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, now the unifying concept of the life sciences.

Engineering management is a specialized form of management that is concerned with the application of engineering principles to business practice.
Engineering management is a career that brings together the technological problem-solving savvy of engineering and the organizational, administrative, and planning abilities of management in order to oversee complex enterprises from conception to पूर्णता.
Example क्षेत्रों of engineering are product development, निर्माण, construction, design engineering, industrial engineering, technology, production, or any other field that employs personnel who perform an engineering function.
कामयाब engineering managers typically require training and अनुभव in कारोबार and engineering.
Technically inept managers tend to be deprived of support by उनके technical team, and non-commercial managers tend to कमी commercial acumen to deliver in a market economy.
Largely, engineering managers manage engineers who are driven by non-entrepreneurial thinking, thus require the necessary people skills to coach, mentor and motivate technical professionals.

In an insurance policy, the deductible is the amount of expenses that must be paid out of pocket before an insurer will pay any expenses.
In general usage, the term deductible may be used to describe one of several types of clauses ( see below ) that are used by insurance companies as a threshold for policy payments.
Deductibles are typically used to deter the large number of trivial claims that a consumer can be reasonably expected to bear the cost of.
By restricting its coverage to events that are significant enough to incur large costs, the insurance firm expects to pay out slightly smaller amounts much less अक्सर, रूष्ट much higher savings.
As a result, insurance premiums are typically cheaper when वे involve higher deductibles.
Deductibles are normally provided as clauses in an insurance policy that dictate how much of an insurance-covered expense is borne by the policyholder.
They are सामान्यतः quoted as a fixed quantity and is a part of most policies covering losses to the policy holder.
The insurer then becomes liable for claimable expenses कि exceed this amount ( subject to the maximum sum claimable indicated in the contract ).
Depending on the policy, the deductible may apply per covered incident, or per year.
For policies where incidences are not easy to delimit ( for example health insurance ), the deductible is typically applied per year.
Several deductibles can be set by the insurer based on the cause of the अर्जी.
For example, a single आवास insurance policy may contain multiple deductible amounts for loss or क्षति arising from theft, fire, natural calamities, evacuation etc.
There are also deductible reimbursement programs that reimburse a deductible in the event of an auto, home, boat/yacht or health insurance claim.

the right main bronchus ( or right primary bronchus, or right principal bronchus ) is a bronchus of the respiratory system.
It is wider, shorter, and अधिक vertical in direction than the left.
It is about 2.5 cm long, and enters the right lung nearly opposite the fifth thoracic vertebra.
The azygos रग arches over it from behind ; and the right pulmonary artery lies at first below and then in front of it.
About 2 cm from its commencement it gives off a branch to the upper lobe of the right lung.
This is termed the eparterial branch of the bronchus, क्युकी it arises above the right pulmonary artery.
the bronchus now passes नीचे the artery, and is known as the hyparterial branch ; it divides into two branches for the middle और lower lobes.
If a foreign body in the airway गुजरता through the trachea, it will most likely enter the right main bronchus instead of the left, due to the straighter alignment of the सही bronchus to the trachea.

Residual oil is oil found in low concentrations naturally or in exhausted oil fields.
Often mixed with water, it can not be recovered by conventional techniques.
However, it can be recovered using carbon dioxide-enhanced oil recovery ( CO2 eor ) which involves injecting carbon dioxide into the well reducing viscosity and enhancing flow of the oil.
The technique is not new but रै not been used extensively on residual oil zones, low-grade deposits of petroleum such as the 38 square miles in the Permian Basin of Texas leased by elliott Roosevelt Jr.
The technique is limited by availability of carbon dioxide.
It does not result in sequestration of the carbon dioxide लकिन the gas is recycled as much as possible.
United States reserves of residual oil are estimated to be 100 billion barrels.

Henry VIII ( 28 June 1491 – 28 January 1547 ) was king of England from 21 April 1509 until his death.
He was lord, and later king, of Ireland, as well as continuing the नाममात्र claim by the अंग्रेज़ी monarchs to the Kingdom of France.
Henry थी the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty, succeeding his father, Henry सात.
Besides his six marriages, हेनरी VIII is known for his role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church.
Henry 's struggles with Rome led to the separation of the Church of England इससे papal authority, the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and his own establishment as the Supreme Head of the Church of England.
Yet he remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings, even after his excommunication इससे the रोमन Catholic Church.
Henry oversaw the विधिक union of England और Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542.
In 1513, the new king allied with the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximillian I, and invaded France in 1513 with a large, well-equipped army, but achieved little at a considerable financial cost.
Maximillian, for his part, used the English invasion to his own ends, and this prejudiced England 's ability to defeat the French.
This foray would prove the प्रारंभ of an obsession for Henry, who invaded again in 1544.
This समय, Henry 's forces captured the important city of Boulogne, but again the Holy रोमन Emperor, Charles V, supported Henry only as long as he needed to and इंग्लैण्ड, strained by the enormous cost of the war, ransomed the city back for peace.
His contemporaries माना Henry in his prime to be an attractive, educated and accomplished king, and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne ''.
Besides ruling with absolute power, he also engaged himself as an लेखक and composer.
His ख्वाहिश to provide England with a male heir – which stemmed partly from personal वैनिटी and partly because he believed a बेटी would be unable to consolidate the Tudor dynasty and the fragile peace that existed following the Wars of the Roses – led to the दो things for which Henry is most remembered : his six marriages and the English Reformation.
Henry became morbidly obese and his health suffered, contributing to his मौत in 1547.
He is frequently characterised in his later जीवन as a lustful, egotistical, harsh, and insecure king.

मैडेन एनएफएल ( known as John Madden Football before 1993 ) is an American football video game series developed by Electronic Arts Tiburon for EA Sports.
The game series is named after Pro Football Hall of Famer John Madden, a well-known former Super Bowl –winning coach of the Oakland Raiders and color commentator.
The series is the best selling EA Sports series.
The games have consistently been a बेहतरीन विक्रेता, and has even spawned TV shows where players compete.
Among the game 's realistic features include sophisticated playbooks and player statistics, and voice commentary कि allows players to hear the game as if it were a real TV broadcast.
The Madden एनएफएल series has been nicknamed the एनएफएल 's 33rd Franchise.
The series was originally conceived by Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins, who then approached Madden in 1984 for his समर्थन and expertise.
Due to Madden 's insistence that the game be as realistic as possible, the first version of John Madden Football was not released जबतक 1988.
The second version of the खेल was released in 1990, with annual versions चूंकि then.
The series ' name was changed to Madden NFL in 1993 after EA acquired the rights to use एनएफएल teams and players.

Wyclef Jeanelle Jean ( ; ; born October 17, 1969 ) Wyclef Dumped इससे Haiti 's Presidential Ballot – TIME, Aug 21, 2010.
`` Before he announced on अगस्त 5 that he was running for President of Haiti, Wyclef Jean was still listing his age as only 37 years old.
But after declaring himself a presidential candidate, the Haitian-American-Irish hip-hop star also decided to come clean and confirm that he was वाकई 40. '' is a three-time Grammy Award -winning Haitian-American rapper, singer-songwriter, musician, record producer, and politician.
At age nine, Jean moved to the United States साथ उसके family and has spent much of his life in the country.
he first received fame as a member of the acclaimed New जर्सी hip हॉप group the Fugees.
On अगस्त 5, 2010, Jean filed for candidacy in the 2010 Haitian presidential election, although the Electoral आयोग subsequently ruled him अयोग्य to स्टैंड as he had not met the requirement to have been resident in Haiti for five years.
Wyclef Jean to appeal against Haiti चुनाव ruling – BBC News, Aug 22, 2010.
हैती 's चुनावी commission said कि Mr Jean was ineligible to stand as the Haitian constitution requires candidates to have lived in the country for five years prior to an election.
The 40-year-old singer lives in the US.
Jean 's efforts at earthquake relief, highly publicized in 2010 throughout Haiti and the United States, were channeled through his charitable organization, yéle Haiti.

In law, a set-off is a statutory defense to the whole or to a portion of a plaintiff 's अर्जी.
It had no existence under the English common law, being created by 2 Geo. II c. 22 लिये the relief of insolvent debtors, although set-off was recognized in इक्विटी.
Such a defense could be pleaded only in respect of mutual debts of a definite character, and did not apply to cases in which damages were claimed, nor to निष्पक्ष claims or demands.
By the rules of the Supreme Court ( O. XIX. r. 3 ) a defendant in an action may set off or set up any right or अर्जी by way of counterclaim against the claims of a plaintiff, and such set-off or counterclaim has the same प्रभाव as a statement of claim in a cross-action.
The legal defense of set-off ( above ) was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person ( `` Party A '' ) who owed money to another ( `` Party B '' ) could be sent to debtors prison, despite the fact that Party B also owed धन to Party A.
The विधि thus allows both parties to defer payment जबतक their respective claims have been सुना in अदालत.
Upon judgment, both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing ( e.g. If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105, the two sums हैं set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A ).
Set-off can भी be incorporated by contractual agreement so that, where a पार्टी defaults, the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off और बुझे.
In certain jurisdictions ( including the UK ), set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company.
This means that, लिये each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company, mutual debts are set-off विरूद्ध each other, and then either the bankrupt 's creditor can अर्जी the balance in the दिवालियापन or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid, depending on which side owed the most.
This has been criticized as an undeclared security interest that violates the principle of pari passu.
The वैकल्पिक, where a creditor has to अदा all its debts, but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that अन्य unsecured लेनदारों get, poses the danger of 'knock-on ' insolvencies.
The right to set off is particularly important when reporting a bank 's exposures to regulatory authorities.
The situation where a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower ( and is therefore exposed, because there is a risk that the borrower might default thereby leading to the loss of the bank 's or its depositors ' money ) is thus replaced ( where the bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower ) with an exposure of the money lent minus the value of the security taken.

Conventional पीसीआई ( PCI is an initialism formed इससे Peripheral Component Interconnect, part of the PCI Local Bus standard and often shortened to just PCI ) is a local computer bus for attaching hardware डिवाइस in a computer.
The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus, but in a standardized स्वरूप that is independent of any particular processor.
Devices connected to the bus appear to the processor to be connected directly to the processor bus, and are assigned addresses in the processor 's address space.
Attached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself, called a planar device in the PCI specification, or an विस्तार card कि fits into a slot.
The PCI लोकल Bus was first implemented in ibm PC compatibles, where it displaced the combination of ISA plus one VESA Local Bus as the bus configuration.
It रै subsequently been adopted लिये अन्य computer types.
PCI and PCI-X are being replaced by PCI Express, but, most motherboards are still made with one or more PCI slots, which are sufficient for many uses.
the PCI specification covers the physical size of the bus ( including the size and spacing of the circuit board edge electrical contacts ), electrical characteristics, bus timing, और protocols.
The specification can be purchased from the PCI Special Interest Group ( PCI-SIG ).
Typical PCI cards used in pcs शामिल : network cards, sound ताश, modems, extra ports such as USB or serial, TV tuner cards and disk controllers.
PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards, until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI ; the preferred interface लिये वीडियो cards became AGP, and then PCI Express.
PCI video cards remain उपलब्धियाँ for use with old PCs without AGP or PCI Express slots.
अनेक devices previously provided on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in सार्वभौमिक serial बस and PCI एक्स्प्रेस versions.
Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline xanthine alkaloid that acts as a stimulant drug.
कैफीन is मिला in varying quantities in the seeds, leaves, and fruit of some plants, where it acts as a natural pesticide that paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding on the plants, as well as enhancing the reward मेमोरी of pollinators.
It is most commonly consumed by humans in infusions extracted from the seed of the coffee plant and the पत्ते of the tea bush, as well as from various foods and drinks containing उत्पाद derived from the kola nut.
Other sources include yerba maté, guarana berries, guayusa, and the yaupon holly.
In humans, caffeine acts as a central nervous system stimulant, temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness.
It is the world 's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal और unregulated in nearly all parts of the world.
पेय containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks, enjoy great popularity.
In North America, 90 % of adults consume caffeine daily.
Part of the reason caffeine is classified by the Food and Drug Administration as GRAS ( generally recognized as safe ) is that विषाक्त doses ( over 10 grams ) are much higher than typically used doses ( less than 500 milligrams ).
Ordinary consumption can have low health risks, even when carried on for years – there may be a modest protective effect विरूद्ध कुछ diseases, including Parkinsons Disease, and निश्चित types of cancer.
Caffeine can have both positive and ऋणात्मक effects on anxiety disorders.
Some people experience sleep disruption if वे consume caffeine, विशेषकर during the evening hours, लकिन others show little disturbance and the effect of caffeine on sleep is highly variable.
प्रमाण of a risk to pregnancy is equivocal, but some authorities have concluded that prudent advice is for pregnant women to limit consumption to the समतुल्य of two cups of coffee per day or less.
The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200 mg प्रति day in pregnant महिलाओं.
Caffeine has pressor और mild diuretic effects when administered to लोगों who are not used to it, but regular users develop a tolerance to this effect, and अध्ययन have generally failed to support the common notion that ordinary खपत contributes significantly to dehydration.
With heavy use, tolerance develops rapidly to autonomic effects such as elevated दिल rate और muscle twitching, लकिन not to the cognitive or arousal effects of caffeine.
The degree to which caffeine can produce clinically significant physical and mental dependence remains a subject of controversy in the medical literature.

Black swan is a 2010 American psychological thriller and horror film directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, and Mila Kunis.
The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake ballet by a prestigious New York City company.
The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile श्वेत Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina ( पोर्टमैन ) is a पूर्ण fit, as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan, जिससे are qualities embodied by the new arrival Lily ( Kunis ).
Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense दबाव when she finds herself competing for the part, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality और descend into a living nightmare.
Aronofsky conceived the premise by connecting his viewings of a उत्पादन of Swan Lake with an unrealized screenplay about understudies and the notion of being haunted by a double, similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers.
aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's `` The दोगुना `` as another inspiration for the film.
The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to his 2008 film the Wrestler, with both films involving demanding प्रदर्शन for different kinds of art.
he and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a ब्रैड attachment to Universal Studios, Black Swan was produced in New York नगर in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures.
पोर्टमैन and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming, and notable figures from the बैले world helped with फिल्मी production to shape the ballet presentation.
The film premiered as the opening film for the 67th Venice International Film Festival on September 1, 2010.
it had a limited release in the United States starting December 3, 2010 and opened nationwide on December 17.
ब्लैक swan received critical praise upon its release, particularly लिये पोर्टमैन 's performance और Aronofsky 's दिशा, and was a significant box office success, grossing $ 329 million worldwide.
The film received five Academy पुरस्कार nominations और Portman won the बेहतरीन Actress award for the film, as well as many other Best अभिनेत्री awards in several guilds and festivals, while Aronofsky was nominated for Best Director.

The world’s first ice-calorimeter, used in the winter of 1782-83, by एंटोनी Lavoisier and pierre-simon Laplace, to determine the heat involved in various chemical changes ; calculations which were based on Joseph Black ’s prior discovery of latent heat.
These experiments mark the foundation of thermochemistry.
A calorimeter ( इससे Latin calor, meaning heat ) is an object used for calorimetry, or the process of measuring the heat of chemical प्रतिक्रियाएँ or physical changes as well as heat capacity.
अवकल स्कैनिंग calorimeters, isothermal microcalorimeters, titration calorimeters and accelerated rate calorimeters are among the most common प्रकार.
A सरल calorimeter just consists of a thermometer attached to a metal container full of water suspended above a combustion chamber.
To find the enthalpy change per mole of a substance A in a प्रतिक्रिया between two substances A and B, the substances are added to a ऊष्मामापी and the initial and final temperatures ( before the प्रतिक्रिया started and after it has finished ) are noted.
Multiplying the temperature change by the mass and specific heat capacities of the substances gives a value for the energy given off or absorbed during the reaction.
Dividing the energy change by how many moles of A were present gives इसके enthalpy change of reaction.
This method is used primarily in academic teaching as it describes the theory of calorimetry.
It does not account for the heat घाटा through the container or the heat capacity of the thermometer and संग्राहक itself.
In addition, the object placed inside the calorimeter shows that the objects transferred their heat to the ऊष्मामापी and into the liquid, and the heat absorbed by the calorimeter और the liquid is equal to the heat given off by the metals.
A pair of green flip-flops
Flip-flops ( भी called zōri, thongs, jandals, or a variety of other names throughout the world ) are a type of open-toed sandal typically worn in casual situations, such as outside or at the बीच.
They consist of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a Y-shaped strap that passes between the first and second toes and around either पक्ष of the foot.
They may also be आयोजित to the foot with a single strap over the front of the foot बल्कि than a thong.
the name `` flip-flop '' originated because of the sound that is made by slapping between the sole of the पैर and the floor जब walking.
This style of footwear has been worn by the people of many cultures throughout the world, originating as early as the ancient Egyptians in 4,000 B.C.
the modern flip-flop descends from the Japanese zōri, which became popular after World War II when soldiers returning to the United States brought them back.
They became popular in casual settings during the 1960s, 1990s, and 2000s, and some varieties have even found their way into more formal attire, despite आलोचना.
The उपयोग of flip-flops can result in many pains and injuries, including ankle sprains and broken bones.
Some individuals who walk for long periods report पीड़ा in the feet, ankles, and lower legs.
The lack of support provided by flip-flops often results in over-pronation injuries, caused by the foot slipping inwards further than normal.
This can lead to flat feet and tendonitis.
Other injuries that may result are due to the जूते 's open-toed nature, such as stubbed toes, cuts, and bruises.
Doctors recommend purchasing pricier sandals with thick-cushioned soles, as well as those that have a strap that is not canvas और that comes back almost to the ankle.
The owners of Hanjin Osaka, seen here transiting the Panama Canal in 2008, declared general average following an explosion in the ship 's engine room on.
The law of general average is a legal principle of maritime law according to which all parties in a sea venture proportionally share कोई losses resulting from a voluntary sacrifice of part of the ship or cargo to save the whole in an emergency.
In the exigencies of hazards faced at sea, crew members often have precious little समय in which to determine precisely whose cargo they are jettisoning.
Thus, to avoid quarrelling that could waste valuable time, there arose the equitable practice whereby all the merchants whose cargo landed safely would be called on to contribute a portion, based upon a share or percentage, to the merchant or merchants whose goods had been tossed overboard to avert imminent peril.
While general औसत traces its origins in ancient maritime law, still it remains part of the admiralty law of most countries.
The first codification of general average was the यॉर्क Antwerp Rules of 1890.
अमरीकी companies accepted it in 1949.
General average requires three elements which are clearly stated by Mr. Justice grier in Barnard v. Adams:
`` 1st.
A common danger : a danger in which vessel, cargo and क्रू all participate ; a danger imminent और apparently 'inevitable, ' except by voluntarily incurring the loss of a portion of the whole to save the remainder. ''
`` 2nd. There must be a voluntary jettison, jactus, or casting away, of some portion of the joint concern लिये the purpose of avoiding this imminent peril, periculi imminentis evitandi causa, or, in other words, a transfer of the peril from the whole to a particular portion of the whole. ''
`` 3rd.
This attempt to avoid the imminent आम peril must be successful ''.
Example Polish call for vaccination against Diphtheria and Tetanus.
A vaccination अनुसूची is a series of vaccinations, including the timing of all doses, which may be either recommended or अनिवार्य, depending on the country of residence.
a vaccine is an antigenic तैयारी used to produce active प्रतिरक्षण to a disease, in order to prevent or reduce the प्रभाव of infection by any प्राकृतिक or `` wild '' pathogen.
Many vaccines require multiple doses for maximum effectiveness, either to produce sufficient आरंभिक immune response or to boost response that fades over time.
For example, tetanus vaccine boosters are often recommended every 10 years.
Vaccine schedules are developed by governmental agencies or physicians groups to achieve maximum effectiveness using required and recommended vaccines for a locality while minimizing the number of health परवाह system interactions.
Over the past two दशकों, the recommended vaccination schedule has grown rapidly and become more complicated as many new vaccines have been developed.
Some vaccines are recommended only in certain areas ( countries, subnational areas, or at-risk populations ) where a disease is common.
For instance, पीला fever vaccination is on the routine vaccine schedule of French Guiana, is recommended in certain regions of Brazil but in the United राज्य is only given to travelers heading to countries with a history of the disease.
In developing countries, vaccine recommendations also take into खाता the level of health care access, the cost of vaccines and issues with vaccine availability and storage.
Sample vaccinations schedules discussed by the संसार Health Organization show a developed country using a schedule which extends over the first five years of a child 's life and uses vaccines which cost over $ 700 including administration costs while a developing country uses a schedule providing vaccines in the पहला 9 months of life and costing only $ 25.
This difference is due to the lower cost of स्वास्थ्य care, the lower cost of many vaccines provided to developing nations, and that more expensive vaccines, often for less common diseases, are not utilized.
in 1900, the smallpox vaccine was the only one administered to children.
By the early 1950s, children routinely received चार vaccines, for protection against ( diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, and smallpox ), और as अनेक as five shots by two years of आयु.
Since the mid-1980s, many vaccines have been added to the schedule.
, the US Centers for Disease कंट्रोल and Prevention ( CDC ) now recommends vaccination against at least fourteen diseases.
By two years of age, U.S. children receive as many as 24 vaccine injections, and might receive up to five shots दौरान one visit to the doctor.
The use of combination vaccine products means that,, the United किंगडम 's immunization program consists of 10 injections by the age of two, rather than 25 if vaccination for each disease was given as a separate injection.

Galileo has been called the `` पिता of modern observational खगोलशास्त्र ``, the `` father of modern physics ``, the `` father of science '', and `` the Father of Modern Science ''.
His contributions to observational astronomy शामिल the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter ( named the Galilean moons in his honour ), and the observation and analysis of sunspots.
Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, inventing an improved military compass and other instruments.
Galileo 's championing of heliocentrism was controversial within his lifetime, when सबसे subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system.

Demonstration of a flexible oled device
An OLED ( सशुल्क light-emitting diode ) is a light-emitting diode ( LED ) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound जिससे emits light in response to an electric current.
This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between दो electrodes.
Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent.
OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, पोर्टेबल systems such as mobile phones, handheld games consoles and PDAs.
A major area of research is the development of white OLED डिवाइस for use in solid-state lighting अनुप्रयोग.
There are two main families of OLEDs : those based on small molecules और those employing polymers.
Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell or लैक, जिससे has a slightly different mode of operation.
OLED displays can use either passive-matrix ( PMOLED ) or active-matrix addressing schemes.
Active-matrix OLEDs ( AMOLED ) require a thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for उच्चतर resolution and larger display sizes.
An OLED display works without a backlight.
Thus, it can प्रदर्शक deep black levels and can be thinner and हल्का than a liquid crystal display ( LCD ).

The Secure Digital format includes four card families available in three different रूप factors.
The four families हैं the असली Standard-Capacity ( SDSC ), the High-Capacity ( SDHC ), the extended-capacity ( SDXC ), and the sdio, which combines input/output functions with data storage.
The three रूप कारकों हैं the असली size, the `` mini '' size, and the `` micro '' size ( see illustration ).
There are many combinations of form factors और device families.
Electrically passive adapters allow the use of a छोटी card in a host device built to hold a larger card.
Host devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide backward compatibility and accept older SD cards, but this article explains several factors that can prevent the use of a newer SD card:
A newer card may offer greater capacity than the host device can handle.
A newer card may use a file system the मेजबान device can not navigate.

However, as साथ other compounds commonly called vitamins, vitamin D was discovered in an effort to find the dietary substance that was lacking in a disease, namely, rickets, the बाल्यकाल form of osteomalacia.
Additionally, like other compounds पुकारा vitamins, in the developed world vitamin D is added to स्टेपल भोजन, such as milk, to avoid disease due to कमियां.
Measures of serum levels reflect endogenous संश्लेषण from exposure to sunlight as well as intake from the diet, और it is believed that synthesis may contribute generally to the maintenance of adequate serum concentrations.
The evidence indicates कि the synthesis of vitamin d from sun exposure works in a feedback लूप that prevents toxicity लकिन, because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight, no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine, USA, for the amount of sun exposure required to मिलें vitamin d आवश्यकताएँ.
Accordingly, the Dietary सन्दर्भ Intakes लिये vitamin D assume कि no synthesis occurs और that all of a person 's vitamin D is from their diet, although that will rarely occur in practice.
In the liver vitamin D is converted to calcidiol, which is also known as calcifediol ( INN ), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D—abbreviated 25 ( OH ) D ; and which is the specific vitamin D metabolite that is measured in serum to determine a व्यक्ति 's vitamin D status.
Part of the calcidiol is परिवर्तित by the kidneys to calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood, regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the स्वस्थ growth और remodeling of bone.
Calcidiol is also converted to calcitriol outside of the kidneys for other उद्देश्य, such as the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of cells ; calcitriol also affects neuromuscular function and inflammation.
Beyond its use to prevent osteomalacia or rickets, the evidence for other health effects of vitamin D supplementation in the general population is inconsistent.
The best evidence of benefit is for bone health and a decrease in mortality in elderly women.
Standard form of the periodic तालिका.
the colors represent different categories of elements explained नीचे.
The periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic numbers, electron configurations, और recurring chemical properties.
तत्व are presented in order of increasing atomic number ( number of protons ).
The standard form of table comprises an 18 × 7 grid or main देह of elements, positioned above a smaller double row of elements.
The table can also be deconstructed into four rectangular blocks : the s-block to the left, the p-block to the सही, the d-block in the middle, and the f-block below that.
The rows of the table are called periods ; the कालम of the s-, d-, and p-blocks are पुकारा groups, with some of these having names such as the halogens or the noble gases.
Since, by definition, a periodic table incorporates recurring trends, any such table can be used to derive relationships between the गुण of the elements and predict the properties of new, yet to be discovered or synthesized, elements.
As a परिणाम, a periodic table—whether in the standard रूप or some other variant—provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior, and such tables are widely used in chemistry and अन्य sciences.
Although precursors exist, Dmitri Mendeleev is generally credited with the publication, in 1869, of the first widely recognized periodic table.
He developed his table to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then-known elements.
Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table.
Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered.
Mendeleev 's periodic table has चूंकि been expanded and refined with the discovery or संश्लेषण of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behavior.
All elements from atomic numbers 1 ( hydrogen ) to 118 ( ununoctium ) have been discovered or synthesized.
The elements from 1 to 98 ( californium ) have महरूम found to exist naturally, although some हैं मिला only in ट्रेस amounts and were initially discovered by synthesis in laboratories.
the elements after 98 have only been synthesized in laboratories.
Production of elements beyond ununoctium is being pursued, with the सवाल of how the periodic table may need to be modified to accommodate any such additions being a matter of ongoing debate.
numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories.

Francesco Albani 's 17th century Baptism of Christ is a typical depiction with the आसमान खोलने and the Holy Spirit descending as a dove.
The baptism of Jesus marks the beginning of his public ministry.
This event is recorded in the canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke.
John 's gospel does not describe Jesus ' baptism, but John the Baptist does testify of the other things in.
In the New Testament, John the Baptist preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ( ), and declared himself a forerunner of he कि would baptize `` साथ the पावन Ghost and with fire '' ( ).
In so doing he was तैयारी the way for यीशु.
Jesus came to the Jordan River where he थी baptized by John.
The baptismal scene includes the आकाश opening, a dove-like descent of the Holy Spirit, and a voice from heaven saying, `` This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. ''
Most modern scholars view the fact that यीशु थी baptized by John as an historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned.
साथ with the crucifixion of Jesus most scholars view it as एक of the two historically certain facts परिचय उसे, and प्रायः use it as the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus.
The baptism is एक of the five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus, the others being the Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension.
Most Christian denominations view the baptism of Jesus as an important इवेंट and a basis for the Christian rite of बपतिस्मा ( see also ).
In Eastern Christianity, Jesus ' baptism is commemorated on 6 January, the feast of epiphany.
In the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Lutheran Churches and some other Western denominations, it is recalled on a day within the following week, the feast of the baptism of the Lord.

It is a Trinitarian feast in the Eastern Orthodox Churches.
Methylcobalamin ( shown ) is a form of vitamin B12.
Physically it resembles the other forms of vitamin B12, occurring as dark red crystals that freely form cherry-colored transparent solutions in water.
Vitamin B12, vitamin B12 or vitamin B-12, also called cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and बेचैन system, और for the formation of blood.
It is एक of the eight B विटामिन.
It is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body, especially affecting DNA synthesis और regulation, but also fatty acid संश्लेषण and energy production.
Neither fungi, पौधे, nor animals are capable of producing vitamin B12.
Only bacteria and archaea have the enzymes required for its synthesis, although many foods हैं a natural source of b12 because of bacterial symbiosis.
The vitamin is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin and can be produced industrially only through bacterial fermentation-synthesis.
Vitamin B12 consists of a class of chemically related compounds ( vitamers ), सब of which have vitamin activity.
It contains the biochemically rare element cobalt.
Biosynthesis of the basic structure of the vitamin is संपन्नता only by जीवाणु ( which usually produce hydroxocobalamin ), but conversion between different forms of the vitamin can be accomplished in the human body.
A common semi-synthetic form of the vitamin, cyanocobalamin, करता not occur in nature, लकिन is produced from bacterial hydroxocobalamin and तब used in many pharmaceuticals and supplements, and as a food additive, because of its स्थिरता and lower production cost.
in the body it is converted to the human physiological forms methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, leaving behind the cyanide, albeit in minimal विशेषज्ञता.
More recently, hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin can be found in more expensive pharmacological उत्पाद and food पूरक.
The extra utility of these is currently debated.
विटामिन B12 was discovered from its relationship to the disease pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disease in which parietal cells of the stomach responsible for secreting intrinsic factor are destroyed.
Intrinsic factor is crucial for the normal अवशोषण of B12, so a lack of intrinsic factor, as seen in pernicious anemia, causes a vitamin B12 deficiency.
Many other subtler kinds of vitamin B12 deficiency और their biochemical effects have since been elucidated.

The औपनिवेशिक history of the United राज्य covers the history of European settlements from the start of colonization of America until their incorporation into the United States.
In the late 16th century, England, France, Spain and the Netherlands launched major colonization programs in eastern North America.
Small early attempts—such as the English Lost Colony of Roanoke —often disappeared ; everywhere the death rate of the first arrivals was very high.
Nevertheless successful colonies were established.
यूरोपीय settlers came from a variety of social and religious groups.
No aristocrats settled permanently, but a number of adventurers, soldiers, किसानो, and tradesmen arrived.
Diversity थी an American characteristic as the Dutch of New Netherland, the Swedes and Finns of New Sweden, the English Quakers of पेन्सिलवेनिया, the अंग्रेज़ी Puritans of New England, the English settlers of Jamestown, and the `` worthy poor '' of Georgia, came to the new continent and built colonies with distinctive social, religious, political और economic styles.
Occasionally one colony took control of another ( दौरान wars between their European parents ).
तभी in Nova Scotia ( अभी part of Canada ) did the conquerors expel the previous colonists.
Instead they all lived side by side in peace.
There were no major civil wars among the 13 colonies, and the two chief armed rebellions ( in Virginia in 1676 and in New York in 1689–91 ) were short-lived failures.
Wars between the French और the British—the French and Indian Wars and Father rale 's War —were recurrent, and involved French-support लिये Wabanaki Confederacy attacks on the frontiers.
By 1760 France was defeated and the British seized its colonies.
The four distinct regions were : New England, the Middle Colonies, the Chesapeake Bay Colonies ( Upper South ) and the Lower South.
कुछ historians add a fifth region, the Frontier, which was never separately organized.
By the time European settlers arrived around 1600–1650, the majority of the Native अमेरिकी living in the पूर्वी United States had been decimated by new diseases, introduced to उन्हें decades before by explorers and sailors.

the चलना Liberty half dollar was a silver 50-cent piece or half dollar सिक्का issued by the संयुक्त States Mint इससे 1916 to 1947 ; it was designed by Adolph A. weinman.
In 1915, the new Mint Director, Robert W. Woolley, आए to believe that he was not only allowed but required by law to replace coin designs that had been in use for 25 years.
He therefore began the process of replacing the Barber coinage : dimes, quarters and half dollars, all bearing similar designs by long-time मिंट Engraver Charles E. Barber, and first struck in 1892.
Woolley had the Commission of Fine Arts conduct a competition, as a result of which Weinman was selected to design the dime and half dollar.
Weinman 's डिज़ाइन of Liberty striding towards the Sun for the हाफ dollar proved difficult to perfect, and Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo, whose department included the Mint, माना having Barber create his own design.
Mint officials यहूद successful in getting Weinman 's design into production, although it never struck very well, जिससे may have been a factor in its replacement by the Franklin half dollar beginning in 1948.
Nevertheless, art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered the piece to be among the most beautiful US सिक्के.
Since 1986, a modification of Weinman 's obverse design has been used for the अमरीकी Silver Eagle.
The Toyota 4Runner is a mid-size खेल utility vehicle ( SUV ) उत्पादित by the Japanese निर्माता Toyota and sold throughout the world from 1984 to present.
In Japan it was known as the Toyota Hilux Surf.
The असली 4Runner was a compact SUV और little more than a Toyota pickup truck with a fiberglass shell over the bed, but the model has since undergone significant स्वतंत्र विकास into a cross between a compact and a mid-size SUV.
All 4Runners have महरूम built at Toyota 's Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, Japan, or at Hino Motors ' Hamura, Japan plant, and in Brazil.

This article deals with medicine as practiced by trained professionals from ancient times to the present.
The प्राचीन Egyptians had a system of medicine that was बहुत advanced for its time and influenced बाद medical traditions.
The Egyptians and Babylonians both introduced the concepts of diagnosis, prognosis, and medical examination.
The Greeks went even further, and advanced as well medical ethics.
The Hippocratic Oath, still taken by doctors today, was written in Greece in the 5th century BCE.
In the medieval era, surgical practices inherited from the ancient masters were improved and then systematized in Rogerius 's The Practice of Surgery.
Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy.
During the Renaissance, understanding of anatomy improved, and the microscope was invented.
The germ theory of disease in the 19th century led to cures for many infectious diseases.
Military doctors advanced the methods of trauma treatment and surgery.
Public health measures were विकसित especially in the 19th century as the rapid growth of cities required systematic sanitary measures.
Advanced research centers opened in the early 20th century, often connected with major hospitals.
The mid-20th century was characterized by new biological treatments, such as antibiotics.
These advancements, along with developments in chemistry, genetics, and lab technology ( such as the x-ray ) led to modern medicine.
आयुर्विज्ञान was heavily professionalized in the 20th century, and new careers opened to women as nurses ( from the 1870s ) and as physicians ( especially बाद 1970 ).
The 21st century is characterized by very उन्नत research involving numerous fields of science.
the Hippocratic Corpus, is a संग्रहण of early medical works from ancient Greece strongly associated with the ancient Greek physician हिपोक्रेटिस and his teachings.
Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K ( from neo-latin kalium ) and परमाणु number 19.
elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and is very प्रतिक्रिया with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite the hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac flame.
Because potassium and sodium are chemically very similar, their salts were not at first differentiated.
The existence of multiple elements in their salts was suspected इससे 1702, and this was सिद्ध in 1807 when potassium and sodium were individually isolated from different salts by electrolysis.
Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic लवण.
As such, it is found dissolved in seawater ( which is 0.04 % potassium by weight ), and is part of many minerals.
Most industrial chemical applications of potassium employ the relatively ऊँची solubility in जल of पोटैशियम compounds, such as potassium soaps.
Potassium metal has only a few खास applications, being replaced in most chemical reactions with sodium metal.
Potassium ions हैं necessary for the फलन of all living cells.
Potassium ion diffusion is a key mechanism in nerve transmission, and पोटैशियम depletion in animals, including humans, results in various cardiac dysfunctions.
Potassium accumulates in plant cells, and thus fresh fruits and vegetables हैं a good dietary source of it.
Conversely, most पौधे except specialist halophytes are intolerant of salt, and sodium is present in them only in low concentration.
This resulted in potassium पहला being isolated from potash, the ashes of पौधे, giving the element its name.
For the same reason, heavy crop production rapidly depletes soils of पोटैशियम, और agricultural fertilizers consume 95 % of वैश्विक potassium chemical production.
The Singapore dollar or dollar ( चिह्न : $ ; code : SGD ) is the official currency of Singapore.
It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively S $ to distinguish it from other dollar -denominated currencies.
It is divided into 100 cents.

The dollar is accepted as `` प्रथागत tender '' in Brunei according to the Currency Interchangeability Agreement.
Likewise, the Brunei dollar is customarily accepted in Singapore
James Samuel Coleman ( May 12, 1926 – March 25, 1995 ) was an American sociologist, theorist and empirical researcher, based chiefly at the University of Chicago.
He was elected president of the अमरीकी Sociological Association.
Coleman studied the sociology of education, पब्लिक policy, और was one of the earliest users of the term `` social capital ``.
His Foundations of सोशल Theory influenced समाजशास्त्रीय theory.
His The Adolescent Society ( 1961 ) and `` Coleman Report '' ( Equality of Educational Opportunity, 1966 ) यहूद two of the most heavily cited books in educational sociology.
The landmark Coleman Report helped transform educational theory, reshape national शिक्षा policies, and influenced पब्लिक and scholarly opinion regarding the role of schooling in determining समता और productivity in the United States.
Superman ( from DC comics ) थी the first superhero created, art by Jim Lee.
A superhero ( sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero ) is a type of stock character possessing `` extraordinary or superhuman शक्तियां '' and dedicated to protecting the public.
Since the debut of the prototypical superhero सुपरमैन in 1938, stories of superheroes—ranging from brief episodic adventures to continuing years-long sagas—have dominated American comic books and crossed over into other media.
The word itself dates to at least 1917.
A female सुपरहीरो is sometimes पुकारा a superheroine ( also rendered super-heroine or सुपर heroine ).
`` SUPER HEROES '' is a trademark co-owned by DC Comics and Marvel Comics.
By most definitions, characters do not strictly require actual superhuman powers to be deemed superheroes, although terms such as costumed crime fighters or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to those such as Batman and Green Arrow बगैर ऐसे powers जो share अन्य common superhero traits.
Such characters were generally referred to as `` mystery men '' in the so-called Golden Age of Comic Books to distinguish them from characters with super-powers.
Normally, superheroes use their powers to counter day-to-day crime while also combating threats against humanity by supervillains, their criminal counterparts.
Often, एक of these supervillains will be the superhero 's archenemy.
As well, some longrunning superheroes, such as Superman, Batman, Spider-Man and Iron Man each has a rogues gallery of enemies.
as well, superheroes sometimes will combat such irregular threats as aliens, magical/ fantasy entities, American war enemies such as nazism or communism, and godlike or demonic creatures.
The following is a historical list of actors and primary character roles which appear on the American soap opera One Life to सजीव.

A will or वसीयत is a legal declaration by which a person, the testator, names one or more persons to manage his/her estate and provides for the transfer of his property at death.
For the devolution of property not disposed of by will, see inheritance and intestacy.
in the strictest sense, a `` होगा '' has historically been limited to real property जबकि `` testament '' applies only to dispositions of personal property ( thus giving rise to the popular title of the document as `` Last Will and वसीयत '' ), हालांकि this distinction is seldom observed today.
A will may also create a testamentary trust that is effective only बाद the death of the testator.
The 19.9 MW Gemasolar solar plant in Spain features 15 hours of storage and can supply power 24 hours a day.
सौर energy, radiant light and heat from the sun, has been harnessed by humans चूंकि ancient times using a range of ever-evolving technologies.
सौर energy technologies शामिल solar heating, solar photovoltaics, solar thermal electricity, solar architecture और artificial photosynthesis, which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the सबसे urgent energy problems the world now faces.
Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy.
Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors to harness the उर्जा.
Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.
In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that `` the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits.
It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise.
These advantages are global.
Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning निवेश ; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared ''.
Sir Thomas More ( ; 7 February 14786 July 1535 ), known to Roman Catholics as Saint Thomas अधिक since 1935, was an English lawyer, social philosopher, author, statesman, and noted Renaissance humanist.
he was an important councillor to Henry VIII of England and थी Lord Chancellor from October 1529 to 16 May 1532.
he was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935 as one of the early martyrs of the schism that separated the Church of England from Rome in the 16th century.
In 2000, Pope John Paul II declared him patron of Catholic statesmen and politicians.
More was an opponent of the Protestant Reformation, in particular of Martin Luther and William Tyndale.
however, since 1980, he is also commemorated by the Church of England as a reformation martyr.
More coined the word `` utopia `` – a name he gave to the ideal and imaginary island nation, the political system of which he described in Utopia, published in 1516.
He opposed the King 's separation from the रोमन Catholic Church and refused to accept him as Supreme Head of the Church of England, a title which had been given by parliament through the Act of Supremacy of 1534.
he थी imprisoned in 1534 for his refusal to take the oath जरूरी by the First Succession Act, because the act disparaged Papal Authority and Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon.
In 1535, he थी आजमाया for treason, convicted on perjured testimony, and beheaded.
More also helped to originate the phrase `` grasp at लोभी '' to mean `` desperately trying even useless things '', in his Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation.
Intellectuals and statesmen आरपार Europe were stunned by More 's execution.
erasmus saluted him as one `` whose soul was more pure than any snow, whose genius was such that England never had and never again will have its like ''.
There was a more controversial side to More 's life, because he advocated the persecution and execution of Protestants who refused to recant their faith.
However, the judgement of history has been largely willing to forgive this in light of the times he lived in and his martyrdom in the Roman Catholic cause.
Two centuries later Jonathan Swift said More was `` the person of the greatest virtue this kingdom ever produced '', a sentiment साथ which Samuel Johnson सहमत.
Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper said in 1977 that More was `` the first great Englishman whom we feel that we know, the most saintly of humanists, the most human of saints, the सार्वभौमिक man of our cool northern renaissance. ''
Captain Nemo, भी known as Prince Dakkar, is a fictional character invented by the French science fiction author Jules वर्न.
Nemo appears in दो of Verne 's novels, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the समुद्र ( 1870 ) and The Mysterious द्वीप ( 1874 ), and makes a cameo appearance in Verne 's play Journey through the Impossible ( 1882 ).
Nemo, one of the most प्रसिद्ध antiheroes in fiction, is a mysterious figure.
The son of an Indian Raja, he is a scientific genius who roams the depths of the sea in his submarine, the Nautilus, which was built on a उजाड़ द्वीप.

ध्वनिक coupler modem
A modem ( modulator-demodulator ) is a device कि modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information, और also demodulates such a carrier signal to डिकोड the transmitted information.
The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data.
Modems can be used over any means of transmitting analog signals, from light emitting diodes to radio.
The most familiar example is a आवाज़ band modem that turns the digital data of a personal computer into modulated विद्युत signals in the voice frequency range of a telephone channel.
These signals can be transmitted over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data.
Modems are generally वर्गीकृत by the amount of data वे can send in a given unit of समय, usually expressed in bits per second ( bit/s, or bps ), or bytes per दूसरी ( B/s ).
Modems can alternatively be classified by their symbol rate, measured in baud.
The baud unit denotes symbols per second, or the number of times per second the modem sends a new signal.
For example, the itu V.21 मानक प्रयुक्त ऑडियो frequency shift keying with two possible frequencies corresponding to two distinct symbols ( or one bit प्रति symbol ), to carry 300 bits per second using 300 baud.
By कंट्रास्ट, the original ITU V.22 standard, which was able to संचारण और receive four distinct symbols ( two bits per symbol ), handled 1,200 bit/s by sending 600 symbols per second ( 600 baud ) using phase shift keying.
The Declaration of Independence is a statement अपनाया by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, which announced कि the thirteen American colonies, then at war with Great Britain, regarded themselves as independent states, and no longer a part of the British Empire.
Instead they अभी formed a new nation—the United राज्य of America.
John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence, which was unanimously स्वीकृत on July 2.
A committee had already drafted the formal declaration, to be तैयार when congress voted on independence.
Adams persuaded the committee to चुनें Thomas Jefferson to लिखें the original draft of the document, which कॉंग्रेस would edit to produce the final version.
The Declaration थी ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the American क्रांतिकारी युद्ध.
The national birthday, the स्वतंत्रता Day is celebrated on जुलाई 4, although Adams wanted July 2.
After ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms.
It थी initially प्रकाशित as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public.
The most famous version of the Declaration, a signed copy that is popularly regarded as the Declaration of Independence, is displayed at the नेशनल Archives in Washington, D.C.
Although the wording of the Declaration was approved on July 4, the date of इसके signing was August 2.
The original July 4 United राज्य Declaration of Independence manuscript was lost while all other copies have महरूम derived इससे this असली document.
The sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry.
the Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against King George III, and by asserting certain natural and विधिक rights, सहित a right of क्रान्ति.
Having served its original purpose in announcing independence, the text of the Declaration was initially ignored बाद the American Revolution.
Since then, it has आइये to be considered a major statement on इंसान अधिकारों, particularly इसके second sentence:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that सब men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
This has been called `` one of the best-known sentences in the English भाषा '', containing `` the most potent and consequential words in American history. ''
the passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive.
इस view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln, who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy, and argued कि the घोषणा is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted.
It रै inspired work for the अधिकारों of marginalized people throughout the world.
The अर्थव्यवस्था of Greenland can be characterized as small, mixed और vulnerable.
The present economy consists of a big public sector and comprehensive foreign trade, which has resulted in an economy साथ periods of strong growth, considerable inflation, unemployment problems and extreme dependence on capital inflow from Denmark and use of outside, mainly Danish, skilled labor.
GDP per capita is similar to the average यूरोपीय economies but the economy is critically dependent upon substantial support from the Danish सरकारी, which supplies about half the revenues of the home नियम government who in turn employ about 8,000 Greenlanders out of a labor force of 40,156 ( Jan. 2012 ).
Unemployment nonetheless remains high, with the rest of the economy dependent upon demand for exports of झींगा and fish.
हाइड्रोजन is a chemical element with symbol H and atomic number 1.
With an atomic weight of ( for hydrogen-1 ), hydrogen is the lightest element and its monatomic form ( H1 ) is the most abundant chemical substance, constituting roughly 75 % of the Universe 's baryonic mass.
Non- remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state.
At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2.
Most of the hydrogen on Earth is in molecules such as water and organic compounds because hydrogen readily forms covalent यौगिकों with most non-metallic elements.
Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry with many reactions exchanging protons between soluble molecules.
In ionic compounds, it can लो a negative charge ( an anion known as a hydride and written as H− ), or as a positively charged species H+.
The latter cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds always occur as more complex species.
The most common isotope of hydrogen is protium ( name rarely used, symbol 1H ) with a single प्रोटॉन and no neutrons.
as the simplest atom known, the hydrogen atom रै been of theoretical use.
For example, as the only neutral atom साथ an analytic solution to the Schrödinger equation, the study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.
हाइड्रोजन gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century, via the mixing of धातुओं with acids.
In 1766–81, Henry Cavendish was the पहला to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, a property which later gave it its name : in Greek, hydrogen means `` water-former ''.
Industrial production is mainly from the भाप reforming of natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like the electrolysis of water.
Most hydrogen is employed near its production site, with the two largest uses being चट्टान fuel processing ( e.g., hydrocracking ) and ammonia production, mostly लिये the fertilizer market.
Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the डिज़ाइन of pipelines and storage tanks.
Unstoppable is a 2010 American कार्रवाई thriller film directed by Tony Scott, लिखा by Mark Bomback, and अभिनीत Denzel Washington and Chris Pine.
the film, loosely based on the real-life CSX 8888 incident, tells the story of a runaway freight train, और the दो मेन ( Washington and Pine ) who मैनेज to stop it.
It थी Scott 's final feature film before his death in 2012.
The film was released in the United राज्य and Canada on November 12, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on November 24, 2010.
It received mostly favorable reviews from film critics ; it garnered a `` Certified Fresh '' rating on सड़े Tomatoes based upon aggregated reviews and a दरजा of `` generally favorable reviews '' at Metacritic.
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Editing at the 83rd Academy Awards, but lost to Inception.
In photography, bracketing is the general तकनीक of taking several shots of the same subject using different camera जमावट.
Bracketing is useful and often recommended in situations that make it difficult to obtain a satisfactory image with a single shot, especially when a small variation in exposure parameters has a comparatively large effect on the resulting image.
autobracketing is स्वचालित bracketing by using a setting on the camera to take several bracketed shots ( in contrast to the photographer altering the settings by हाथ between each shot ).
Given the time it takes to accomplish अनेक shots, it is typically, but not सदा, used for स्थिर subjects.
Insulated glazing ( ig ), more commonly known as double glazing ( or double-pane, and increasingly triple glazing/pane ) are double or triple glass window panes separated by an air or अन्य gas filled space to reduce ऊष्मा transfer across a part of the building envelope.
Insulated Glass इकाई are manufactured with glass in range of thickness इससे 3 mm to 10 mm or more in special applications.
Laminated or tempered glass may also be used as part of the construction.
Most units are manufactured with the same thickness of glass used on both panes but special applications such as acoustic attenuation or security may require wide ranges of thicknesses to be incorporated in the same ईकाई.
A sectioned diagram of a fixed Insulated Glazed Unit ( IGU ), indicating the numbering convention used in this article.
Surface # 1 is facing outside, Surface # 2 is the अंदर surface of the exterior pane, Surface # 3 is the outside surface of the interior pane, and Surface # 4 is the inside सतह of interior pane.
The window frame is labelled # 5, a spacer is indicated as # 6, seals are shown in red ( # 7 ), the internal reveal is on the right hand side ( # 8 ) and the exterior windowsill on the left ( # 9 )
To reduce shear effects on the sealed unit ( a major cause of premature failure ), manufacturers use a rule of thumb that permits a difference of 1 mm between the thickness of the panes of glass used in the unit and still maintain the warranty for the unit.
For example, a unit may be ordered with a 4 mm pane on the exterior और a 3 mm pane on the interior.

Uses in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices.
Selenium continues to be used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum बिन्दु.
Selenium salts हैं toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms, including all animals.
Selenium is a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase ( which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and कुछ plants ).

Mechanical repair
Maintenance, repair, and operations ( MRO ) or maintenance, repair, and overhaul involves fixing any sort of mechanical, plumbing or विद्युत device should it become out of order or broken ( known as repair, unscheduled or casualty maintenance ).
It also includes performing routine actions which keep the device in working order ( known as scheduled maintenance ) or prevent trouble from arising ( preventive मेंटेनेंस ).
mro may be defined as, `` सब actions which have the उद्देश्य of retaining or restoring an item in or to a राज्य in which it can perform its required फलन.
The actions include the combination of all technical and सम्बन्धित administrative, managerial, and supervision actions. ''
mro operations can be categorised by whether the product remains the property of the customer, i.e. a service is being offered, or whether the product is bought by the reprocessing organisation and sold to any customer wishing to make the purchase ( Guadette, 2002 ).
In the former case it may be a backshop operation within a larger organisation or छोटी operation.
The former of these represents a closed loop supply chain and usually रै the scope of maintenance, repair or of the उत्पाद.
The latter of the categorisations is an open loop supply chain and is typified by refurbishment and remanufacture.
The प्रमुख characteristic of the closed loop system is that the demand for a product is matched with the supply of a used product.
Neglecting asset write-offs and exceptional activities the total population of the product between the customer और the service provider remains निरंतर.

The electron transport chain in the mitochondrion is the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes.
The NADH and succinate generated in the citric एसिड cycle are oxidized, providing energy to power ATP synthase.
photosynthetic electron transport chain of the thylakoid membrane.
An electron transport chain ( ETC ) couples इलेक्ट्रॉन transfer between an electron donor ( such as nadh ) and an इलेक्ट्रॉन acceptor ( such as O2 ) with the transfer of H+ ions ( protons ) across a membrane.
the resulting electrochemical proton gradient is used to generate chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ).
Electron transport जंजीरों are the सेल्यूलर mechanisms used for extracting energy from sunlight in photosynthesis and also इससे redox reactions, ऐसे as the oxidation of sugars ( respiration ).
In chloroplasts, light drives the conversion of water to oxygen and NADP+ to NADPH with transfer of H+ ions across chloroplast membranes.
In mitochondria, it is the conversion of oxygen to water, NADH to NAD+ and succinate to fumarate कि हैं required to generate the proton अनुपात.
Electron transport chains are प्रमुख sites of premature इलेक्ट्रॉन leakage to oxygen, generating superoxide and potentially resulting in increased oxidative stress.

Monument of Tycho Brahe और Johannes Kepler in Prague
Tycho Brahe ( 14 December 154624 October 1601 ), born Tyge Ottesen Brahe, was a Danish nobleman ज्ञात for his सटीक and comprehensive astronomical और planetary observations.
He was born in Scania, then part of Denmark, now part of modern-day Sweden.
Tycho थी well known in उसके lifetime as an astronomer and alchemist.
In his De nova stella ( On the new star ) of 1573, he refuted the aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial फ्रेम.
His precise measurements indicated that `` new stars, '' ( stellae novae, now known as supernovae ) in particular that of 1572, lacked the parallax expected in sub-lunar phenomena, and were therefore नहीं `` atmospheric '' tailless comets as previously believed, but were above the माहौल and moon.
Using similar measurements he showed that comets यहूद also not atmospheric phenomena, as previously thought, and must pass through the supposedly `` अपरिवर्तनीय '' celestial spheres.
As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical लाभ of the Ptolemaic system into his अपना model of the universe, the Tychonic system.
Furthermore, he was the last of the प्रमुख naked eye astronomers, working without telescopes for his observations.
Tycho ब्राहे was granted an estate on the island of Hven and the funding to build the Uraniborg, an early research institute, where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements, and later Stjerneborg, underground, when he discovered कि his instruments in the former were not sufficiently steady.
On the island ( on which he demonstrated autocratic character and behavior toward the residents ) he founded manufactories such as paper-making to provide material for मुद्रण his results.
After disagreements with the नई Danish किंग Christian IV in 1597, he was invited by the Bohemian king and Holy Roman emperor Rudolph II to Prague, where he became the official imperial astronomer.
He built the new observatory at Benátky nad Jizerou.
Here, from 1600 until his death in 1601, he थी assisted by Johannes Kepler who later used Tycho 's astronomical data to develop Kepler 's laws of planetary motion.
guro District ( guro-gu ) is a district of Seoul, South Korea, which was separated from Yeongdeungpo District on April 1, 1980.
Located in the southwestern part of the city, where besides Yangcheon District and Geumcheon ज़िला Guro ज़िला रै an important position as a transport link which contains railroads, land routes from the rest of Seoul to the दक्षिण of the country.
The Gyeongbu और Gyeongin railway lines कनेक्ट Seoul to Busan and Incheon.
In addition, Seoul Metropolitan Subway लाइनों 1, 2, and 7, and major highways intersect in Guro District.
The name Guro originates from the लेजेंड that nine ( ) old men ( Korean : ro ) enjoyed longevity in the district.
A digital industrial जटिल is located in Guro District.
The Guro Digital Industrial Complex, which played a leading industrial role mainly with textile manufacturing, dressmaking and other labour-intensive industries in 1967, has been rapidly changed into an IT industrial complex.
This जटिल played a pivotal role in the economic विकास of the दक्षिण Korea 's development era, referred to as the `` Miracle on the Han River ``, and also contributed 10 percent of national export in the 1970s.
Twenty-one percent of the total area of Guro District is a restricted zone to be used as a greenbelt with the only arboretum in Seoul.
The zone is changing into a lively district as large labour-intensive factories हैं moving from the area and the council is developing what it terms its चार zones.

A wonton ( also spelled wantan, wanton, or wuntun in transcription from Cantonese ; Mandarin : húndùn ) is a type of dumpling commonly found in a number of Chinese cuisines.
Many people were involved in the invention of radio as we अभी know it.
Several possible methods of wireless communication were considered, including inductive and capacitive प्रेरण and transmission through the ground, however the method used for radio today exclusively involves the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves.
After early speculation on the subject, experimental work on the connection between electricity and magnetism began around 1820 with the work of Hans Christian Ørsted and continued with the work of André-Marie Ampère, Joseph Henry, and Michael Faraday.
These investigations culminated in the पूरा theory of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell.
This theory described the theoretical basis of the propagation of electromagnetic लहरें.
After Maxwell 's theory थी published many people experimented with बेतार communication, some intentionally using Maxwell 's theory some not.
It is considered likely that the first intentional transmission of a signal by means of electromagnetic waves was performed by David Edward Hughes around 1880, although this was considered to be induction at the time.
The पहला systematic and unequivocal transmission of em waves was performed by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz and described in papers published in 1887 and 1890.
हर्ट्ज़ famously considered these results as होने of छोटी practical value.
After Hertz 's work many लोगों were involved in the development of components and theory involved with the transmission और reception of इलेक्ट्रोमैग्नेटिक waves.
Others, notably guglielmo Marconi, were concerned with practical improvements and the commercial application of radio to wireless telegraphy.
Later on Reginald A. Fessenden became the first to send an ऑडियो signal by अर्थात् of electromagnetic waves.
Scurvy is a disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C, which is जरूरी for the synthesis of collagen in humans.
The chemical name for vitamin C, ascorbic acid, is निकला from the Latin name of scurvy, scorbutus, which भी provides the adjective scorbutic ( `` of, characterized by or having to do with scurvy '' ).
Scurvy often presents itself initially as symptoms of malaise and lethargy, followed by formation of spots on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding from the mucous membranes.
Spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a person with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially immobilized.
As स्कर्वी advances, वहीँ can be खोलें, suppurating wounds, loss of teeth, jaundice, fever, neuropathy and death.
Scurvy थी at one time common among sailors, pirates और others aboard ships at sea longer than perishable fruits और vegetables could be stored ( subsisting instead only on cured and salted meats and dried grains ) and by soldiers similarly deprived of these foods for extended periods.
It was described by Hippocrates ( c. 460 BC–c. 380 BC ), and herbal cures for scurvy have been known in many native cultures since prehistory.
Scurvy was one of the limiting factors of marine travel, often killing large numbers of the passengers और crew on long-distance voyages.
This became a significant issue in Europe from the beginning of the modern era in the Age of Discovery in the 15th century, continuing to play a significant भूमिका through World War I in the 20th century.
While today scurvy is known to be caused by a nutritional deficiency, until the अलगाव of vitamin C and direct evidence of its कड़ी to scurvy in 1932, numerous theories and treatments were proposed, often on छोटी or no experimental data.
इस inconsistency is attributed to the कमी of विटामिन C as a distinct concept, an inability to reliably link different foods ( notably present in भैस citrus, watercress, and organ meat ) to स्कर्वी.
An additional अवधारणा required to understand scurvy थी the degradation of vitamin C by exposure to air and copper and other transition metal salts such as those of iron, thus changing the कड़ी of foods to स्कर्वी over time.
Treatment by fresh food, particularly citrus fruit, was periodically implemented, as it had been since antiquity.
However until the 1930s, treatment was inconsistent, साथ many अप्रभावी treatments प्रयुक्त into the 20th century.
It was a Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind who first proved it could be treated with citrus fruit in experiments he described in उसके 1753 book, A Treatise of the Scurvy, though his advice was not implemented by the Royal Navy for several decades.
In infants, scurvy is sometimes referred to as Barlow 's disease, named after Sir Thomas Barlow, a British physician who described it.
However, Barlow 's disease may भी refer to mitral valve prolapse.
Other eponyms for scurvy include Moeller 's disease and Cheadle 's disease.
Scurvy does not occur in सबसे animals because they can synthesize their अपना vitamin C.
However, इंसानो and other higher primates ( the simians - monkeys and apes - and tarsiers ), guinea सूअर, most or all bats, and some species of birds and मछली lack an enzyme ( L-gulonolactone oxidase ) necessary for such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet.
Vitamin C is widespread in संयंत्र tissues, with particularly ऊँची concentrations occurring in citrus fruits ( oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits ), tomatoes, आलू, cabbages, and green peppers.
Iron is a chemical element with the symbol Fe ( from ) and atomic number 26.
It is a metal in the first transition series.
It is the most आम element ( by mass ) forming the planet Earth as a whole, forming much of Earth 's outer and inner core.
It is the fourth सबसे common element in the Earth 's crust.
Iron 's very common presence in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production as a result of fusion in high-mass stars, where the production of nickel-56 ( जिससे decays to the most common isotope of iron ) is the last nuclear fusion reaction that is exothermic.
This causes radioactive nickel to become the पिछला element to be produced before collapse of a supernova leads to the explosive events that scatter this precursor radionuclide of iron abundantly into space.
Like other समूह 8 elements, iron exists in a wide range of oxidation राज्य, −2 to +6, although +2 and +3 are the most common.
elemental आयरन occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water.
Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated आयरन oxides, commonly known as rust.
Unlike many अन्य metals which form passivating oxide layers, iron oxides occupy more volume than iron metal, and thus iron oxides flake off and expose fresh surfaces for corrosion.
Iron metal has been used since ancient times, though copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used first in history.
Pure आयरन is soft ( softer than aluminium ), but is unobtainable by smelting.
The सामग्री is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities from the smelting process, such as carbon.
A certain proportion of carbon ( between 0.002 % और 2.1 % ) produces steel, which may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron.
Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a ऊँची कार्बन content.
Further refinement साथ ऑक्सीजन reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel.
Steels and कम carbon iron alloys with other metals ( alloy steels ) are by far the सबसे common metals in industrial use, due to their great range of desirable properties and the abundance of iron.
Iron chemical compounds, which include ferrous and ferric compounds, have many uses.
Iron oxide मिश्रित with aluminium चूर्ण can be ignited to create a thermite प्रतिक्रिया, used in welding and purifying ores.
It forms binary compounds with the हैलोजन्स and the chalcogens.
Among its कार्बधातुक compounds is ferrocene, the first sandwich compound discovered.
Iron plays an important role in biology, forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin ; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates.
Iron is also the metal used at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.

A potato chip ( known as a chip in American, Australian, New Zealand, Canadian, Singaporean, Hong Kong, South African and Jamaican English ; as a crisp in British English and hiberno-english, and as either a chip or wafer in Indian English ) is a thin slice of potato that is deep fried or baked until crunchy.
Potato chips are commonly परोसा as an appetizer, side dish, or snack.
The basic chips are cooked and salted ; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including seasonings, herbs, spices, cheeses, and artificial additives.
`` crisps '', however, may also refer to many different types of savory snack products sold in the United Kingdom and Ireland, some made from potato, but may also be made from maize, tapioca or other cereals.
An example of these kinds of savory स्नैक्स is Monster Munch.
Potato chips are a predominant part of the snack food market in English-speaking countries and numerous अन्य Western nations.
The वैश्विक potato chip market उत्पन्न total revenues of US $ 16.4 billion in 2005.
This accounted for 35.5 % of the total savory snacks market in that year ( US $ 46.1 billion ).

Notice of Stamp Act of 1765 in Newspaper
American अखबारों reacted to the Stamp Act with anger and predictions of the demise of journalism.
The Stamp Act 1765 ( छोटी title Duties in American Colonies Act 1765 ; 5 George III, c. 12 ) imposed a direct tax by the British Parliament specifically on the colonies of British अमेरिका, and it required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp.
ये printed materials were legal documents, magazines, newspapers and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies.
Like previous taxes, the stamp tax था to be paid in valid अंग्रेजों करेंसी, not in colonial paper money.
The purpose of the tax was to help pay for troops stationed in North America after the British victory in the सात Years ' War.
The British government felt that the colonies were the primary beneficiaries of this military presence, and should pay at least a portion of the expense.
The Stamp Act met great resistance in the colonies.
The colonies sent no representatives to Parliament, and therefore had no influence over what taxes were raised, how they were levied, or कैसा they would be spent.
Many colonists considered it a violation of their rights as अंग्रेजो to be taxed without उनके consent —consent that तभी the colonial legislatures could grant.
Colonial assemblies sent petitions and विरोध.
the Stamp Act Congress held in New York City, reflecting the first significant joint colonial response to कोई अंग्रेजों measure, also petitioned पार्लियामेंट and the King.
Local विरोध groups, led by colonial merchants and landowners, established connections through correspondence that created a ढीला coalition that extended from New England to Georgia.
Protests and demonstrations initiated by the Sons of Liberty often turned violent and destructive as the masses became involved.
Very soon all stamp tax वितरकों were intimidated into resigning their commissions, and the tax was never effectively collected.
Opposition to the Stamp Act थी not सीमित to the colonies.
British merchants and manufacturers, whose निर्यात to the colonies यहूद threatened by colonial economic problems exacerbated by the tax, also pressured पार्लियामेंट.
the Act was repealed on March 18, 1766 as a matter of expedience, but Parliament affirmed its शक्ति to legislate for the colonies “in all cases whatsoever” by also passing the Declaratory Act.
There followed a series of नई कर and regulations, likewise opposed by the colonists.
The episode played a major role in defining the grievances and enabling the organized colonial resistance that led to the American Revolution in 1775.

An iPhone that can be used as a geological compass because of the 3-axis teslameter and 3-axis accelerometer inside it
A military compass that was प्रयुक्त during World War I.
A compass is a navigational instrument that shows directions in a frame of reference that is stationary relative to the surface of the धरती.
The frame of reference defines the four कार्डिनल directions ( or points ) – north, south, east, and वेस्ट.
Intermediate directions are also defined.
प्रायः, a diagram called a compass rose, which shows the दिशानिर्देश ( with उनके names usually abbreviated to initials ), is marked on the compass.
जब the compass is in use, the rose is aligned with the real directions in the frame of सन्दर्भ, so, for example, the `` N '' चिह्नित on the रोज़ really points to the north.
अक्सर, in addition to the रोज़ or sometimes instead of it, angle markings in degrees are shown on the compass.
उत्तर corresponds to zero degrees, and the कोण increase clockwise, so ईस्ट is 90 degrees, south is 180, and west is 270.
These संख्याएँ allow the compass to show azimuths or bearings, which are commonly stated in this संकेतन.
The magnetic compass was first invented as a device for divination as early as the Chinese Han Dynasty ( Since about 206 BC ).
The कम्पास was used in सोंग Dynasty China by the military for navigational orienteering by 1040-1044, and was used for maritime नेविगेशन by 1111 to 1117.

Located at the पश्च of the abdominal cavity in the retroperitoneum, the kidneys receive blood from the paired renal धमनियों, and नाली into the paired renal veins.
Each kidney excretes urine into a ureter, itself a paired structure that empties into the urinary bladder.
Renal physiology is the study of kidney function, while nephrology is the चिकित्सा specialty concerned with kidney diseases.
Diseases of the kidney are diverse, but individuals with kidney disease frequently display characteristic clinical features.
Common clinical conditions involving the kidney include the nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, renal cysts, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis, and urinary tract obstruction.
Various cancers of the kidney exist ; the most common adult renal cancer is renal cell carcinoma.
Cancers, cysts, and some other renal conditions can be managed with removal of the kidney, or nephrectomy.
When renal function, measured by glomerular filtration rate, is persistently poor, dialysis और kidney transplantation may be treatment options.
Although they are not severely नुकसानदेह, kidney stones can be painful and a nuisance.
The removal of kidney stones involves ultrasound treatment to break up the stones into smaller टुकड़े, which are then passed through the urinary tract.

`` The core विचार of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care when they act by taking account of the संभावित harm that they might foreseeably cause harm to other people. ''
`` those who go personally or bring property where they जान that they or it may come into collision with the persons or property of others have by law a duty cast upon them to use reasonable care and skill to avoid such a collision. ''
Fletcher v rylands ( [ 1866 ] lr 1 Ex 265 )
Through civil वाद, if an injured person proves that another person acted negligently to cause उनके injury, they can recover damages to compensate लिये their harm.

Although resulting damages must be proven in order to recover compensation in a negligence action, the nature and extent of those damages are not the primary focus of negligence cases.

Natural gas extraction by countries in cubic meters per year.
Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon गैस mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly सहित varying amounts of अन्य hydrocarbons, कार्बन dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen sulfide.
Natural gas is an energy source often used for heating, cooking, and electricity generation.
It is also प्रयुक्त as fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals.
Natural गैस is found in deep underground natural rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates.
Petroleum is also another resource found in proximity to और with natural gas.
Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms : biogenic and thermogenic.
Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes, bogs, landfills, and shallow sediments.
Deeper in the earth, at greater temperature and pressure, thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material.
Before प्राकृतिक gas can be प्रयुक्त as a fuel, it must undergo processing to remove impurities, including जल, to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas.
The by-products of processing include ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and उच्चतर molecular weight hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide ( which may be परिवर्तित into pure गंधक ), carbon dioxide, water vapor, and sometimes helium और nitrogen.

The name comes from the animal 's reported habit of attacking and पीने the blood of livestock, especially goats.
Physical descriptions of the creature vary.
Eyewitness sightings have been claimed as जल्दी as 1995 in प्यूर्टो Rico, and have since been reported as far north as Maine, and as far south as Chile, and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like Russia and The Philippines.
It is supposedly a heavy creature, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines reaching from the गर्दन to the base of the tail.

Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal पर्यावरण and is assessed by subjective evaluation ( ANSI / ASHRAE Standard 55 ).
Maintaining this standard of thermal comfort for occupants of buildings or other enclosures is one of the important goals of HVAC ( heating, ventilation, and एयर conditioning ) design engineers.
the Predicted Mean Vote ( PMV ) model stands among the most recognized thermal comfort models.
It was developed using principles of heat balance and experimental data collected in a controlled climate chamber under steady राज्य conditions.
Because the PMV मॉडल was derived from data collected in a controlled climate, it is not suitable for applications in naturally ventilated spaces which प्रायः have high levels of air movement.
This shortcoming motivated the development of a family of empirical statistical models of thermal comfort in naturally ventilated स्पेसेस known as adaptive models.
Adaptive models of थर्मल comfort consider occupants as dynamically interacting with their पर्यावरण, and controlling their thermal comfort by means of clothing or window-opening and closing.
This is in contrast to thermal comfort in sealed buildings, in which occupants experience the पर्यावरण passively.
Thermal comfort is affected by heat conduction, संवहन, radiation, and evaporative heat loss.
Thermal सुकून is maintained when the heat उत्पन्न by human metabolism is allowed to dissipate, thus maintaining thermal equilibrium with the surroundings.
It has been long recognized that the sensation of feeling hot or cold is not just dependent on air temperature alone.
Thermal comfort calculations according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 can be freely performed with the CBE Thermal Comfort Tool for ashrae-55.

Family transmission of Basque language ( Basque as initial language )
Percentage of students registered in Basque language schools ( 2000–2005 ).
Location of the Basque-language provinces within Spain and फ़्रांस
Basque ( endonym :, ) is the ancestral language of the Basque people, जो inhabit the Basque Country, a region spanning an area in northeastern स्पेन और southwestern France.
It is spoken by 27 % of Basques in all territories ( 714,136 आउट of 2,648,998 ).
Of ये, 663,035 live in the Spanish part of the Basque country और the remaining 51,100 live in the फ्रेंच part.
In academic discussions of the distribution of Basque in Spain and France, it is customary to refer to three ancient provinces in France और four Spanish provinces.
Native speakers are concentrated in a contiguous area including parts of the Spanish autonomous communities of the Basque Country and Navarre and in the western half of the French département of Pyrénées-Atlantiques.
The Basque Autonomous Community is an administrative entity within the binational ethnographic बास्क देश incorporating the traditional Spanish provinces of Biscay, Gipuzkoa, and álava, which retain their existence as politico-administrative divisions.
These provinces and many areas of Navarre are heavily populated by ethnic Basques, but Basque was, at least जबतक the 1990s, not spoken as a native भाषा in most of Álava, western parts of Biscay and central and southern areas of Navarre, either because it had been replaced by Spanish along the centuries, in some areas, or because it had never been बोला there, in other areas.
In southwestern France, the प्राचीन Basque-populated provinces were Labourd, Lower Navarre, and Soule.
They and other regions were consolidated into a single département in 1790 under the name Basses-Pyrénées, a name which persisted until 1970.

Euskara Batua was created so that Basque language could be used—and easily understood by सब Basque speakers—in formal situations ( education, mass मीडिया, literature ), and this is its main use today.

In most areas of the Spanish Basque देश, the educational मॉडल D, where all subjects are taught in Basque, except `` Spanish language and literature '' ( which is taught in Spanish ) is now the predominant model.
In France, the Basque language school Seaska and the association for a दुभाषिया ( Basque and French ) schooling Ikasbi meet a wide range of Basque language educational needs up to the Sixth Form, while often struggling to surmount financial and administrative constraints.
अलावा इससे this standardized version, there are पाँच प्रमुख Basque dialects : Bizkaian, Gipuzkoan, and Upper Navarrese in Spain, and Navarrese–Lapurdian and Zuberoan ( in France ).
Although they take their names from the mentioned ऐतिहासिक provinces, the dialect boundaries are नहीं congruent with province सीमाएँ.

Political economy was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested `` economics '' as a shorter term for `` economic विज्ञान '' that also avoided a narrow political-interest connotation and as similar in रूप to `` mathematics ``, `` ethics '', और so forth.
A focus of the subject is how economic agents behave or interact and how economies work.
Consistent with this, a primary textbook distinction is between microeconomics and macroeconomics.
Microeconomics examines the behavior of basic elements in the economy, including individual agents ( such as households and firms or as buyers and sellers ) and markets, and their interactions.
Macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy and issues affecting it, including unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and monetary and fiscal policy.
Other broad distinctions include those between positive economics ( describing `` what is '' ) and normative economics ( advocating `` what ought to be '' ) ; between economic theory and applied अर्थशास्त्र ; between rational and behavioral economics ; and between मुख्यधारा economics ( more `` orthodox '' and dealing with the `` rationality-individualism-equilibrium nexus '' ) and heterodox economics ( अधिक `` radical '' and dealing with the `` institutions-history-social structure nexus '' ).
Economic विश्लेषण may be applied throughout society, as in business, finance, health care, and government, but also to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, law, politics, religion, social institutions, war, and science.
At the turn of the 21st century, the expanding डोमेन of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism.
An increasing number of अर्थशास्त्रियों have called for increased emphasis on environmental sustainability ; this area of research is known as Ecological economics.
