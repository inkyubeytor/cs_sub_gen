The legal रक्षा of set-off ( above ) was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person ( `` Party A '' ) who owed money to another ( `` Party B '' ) could be sent to debtors prison, despite the fact कि Party B also owed money to Party A.
the विधि यूँ allows both पार्टियों to टालना भुगतान until their respective claims have been heard in court.
Upon निर्णय, दोनो claims are extinguished और replaced by a सिंगल net sum owing ( e.g. If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105, the two sums हैं set off और replaced with a single obligation of 5 इससे Party b to पार्टी A ).
set-off can also be incorporated by contractual अनुबंध so that, where a पार्टी defaults, the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and बुझे.
In certain jurisdictions ( including the uk ), set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company.
इस means कि, for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company, mutual debts are set-off विरूद्ध each other, and then either the bankrupt 's creditor can अर्जी the balance in the दिवालियापन or the trustee in bankruptcy can पूछो for the balance remaining to be सशुल्क, depending on जिससे side owed the most.
This has been criticized as an undeclared security interest कि violates the principle of परी passu.
The वैकल्पिक, where a creditor रै to pay सब its debts, लकिन receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured लेनदारों get, मुद्राएँ the danger of 'knock-on ' insolvencies.
The right to set off is particularly important when reporting a bank 's exposures to regulatory authorities.
the situation where a bank has to report कि it रै lent a large sum to a borrower ( and is therefore उजागर, because there is a रिस्क that the borrower might default thereby अग्रणी to the loss of the बैंको 's or its depositors ' money ) is यूँ replaced ( where the bank रै taken security over shares or प्रतिभूति of the borrower ) with an exposure of the money lent minus the value of the security taken.

Conventional PCI ( PCI is an initialism formed इससे Peripheral Component Interconnect, part of the पीसीआई Local Bus standard और often shortened to बस PCI ) is a लोकल computer bus for attaching हार्डवेयर devices in a computer.
The PCI bus supports the कृत्यों found on a processor bus, लकिन in a standardized स्वरूप कि is independent of कोई particular प्रोसेसर.
डिवाइस connected to the bus appear to the processor to be connected directly to the प्रोसेसर बस, and are आबंटित addresses in the processor 's पता space.
संलग्न devices can लो either the रूप of an integrated circuit fitted onto the मदरबोर्ड itself, called a planar यंत्र in the PCI specification, or an expansion card that fits into a स्लॉट.
The PCI Local बस थी पहला implemented in IBM pc compatibles, where it displaced the संयोजन of ISA plus one VESA लोकल बस as the bus configuration.
It has subsequently been अपनाया लिये other कंप्यूटर types.
PCI and PCI-X are being replaced by पीसीआई Express, लकिन, सबसे motherboards हैं still made with one or अधिक पीसीआई स्लॉट, which हैं sufficient for many uses.
The पीसीआई specification covers the physical size of the bus ( including the size and spacing of the circuit board edge electrical contacts ), electrical characteristics, बस timing, and protocols.
The specification can be purchased from the PCI Special Interest समूह ( PCI-SIG ).
Typical PCI ताश used in PCs include : संजाल ताश, ध्वनि cards, modems, extra ports ऐसे as USB or सीरियल, TV tuner ताश and डिस्क परिरक्षक.
पीसीआई video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards, until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI ; the preferred इंटरफ़ेस लिये video cards became AGP, and then PCI Express.
PCI video cards remain available लिये use with old pcs without AGP or PCI Express slots.
Many devices previously provided on PCI विस्तार ताश are अभी commonly एकीकृत onto motherboards or available in universal सीरियल bus and PCI Express versions.
Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline xanthine alkaloid that acts as a stimulant ड्रग.
कैफीन is found in varying quantities in the seeds, leaves, and fruit of some पौधे, where it acts as a natural pesticide कि paralyzes and kills निश्चित insects feeding on the plants, as well as enhancing the reward memory of pollinators.
It is most commonly consumed by humans in infusions extracted इससे the seed of the coffee plant और the leaves of the tea बुश, as well as इससे various foods and drinks containing उत्पाद derived from the kola nut.
Other sources include yerba maté, guarana berries, guayusa, और the yaupon holly.
In humans, कैफीन अधिनियमों as a central nervous प्रणाली उत्तेजक, temporarily warding बंद drowsiness और restoring alertness.
It is the संसार 's सबसे widely consumed psychoactive drug, but unlike अनेक other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly सब parts of the world.
Beverages containing कैफीन, such as कॉफी, tea, soft drinks, और energy drinks, enjoy great popularity.
In उत्तर America, 90 % of वयस्कों consume caffeine daily.
भाग of the reason caffeine is classified by the Food and Drug Administration as ग्रा ( generally recognized as safe ) is that विषाक्त doses ( over 10 grams ) are much उच्चतर than typically used doses ( less than 500 milligrams ).
ordinary खपत can have low स्वास्थ्य risks, भी when carried on लिये सालो – there may be a modest सुरक्षात्मक effect against some diseases, including parkinsons Disease, and certain types of कर्कट.
कैफीन can have दोनो धनात्मक and negative प्रभाव on चिंता disorders.
कुछ people अनुभव sleep disruption if they consume कैफीन, विशेषकर during the evening hours, but others दिखाएँ छोटी disturbance and the effect of caffeine on नींद is highly परिवर्तनीय.
Evidence of a रिस्क to pregnancy is equivocal, but कुछ अधिकारियों have concluded that prudent advice is for गर्भवती महिलाओं to सीमा consumption to the equivalent of two cups of coffee प्रति day or less.
The अमरीकी Congress of Obstetricians और Gynecologists ( ACOG ) concluded in 2010 that caffeine खपत is safe up to 200 mg per day in गर्भवती women.
Caffeine has pressor and mild diuretic प्रभाव जब administered to people who हैं नहीं used to it, but नियमित users develop a tolerance to this effect, और studies have generally failed to support the common notion कि ordinary consumption contributes significantly to निर्जलीकरण.
साथ भारी use, tolerance develops rapidly to autonomic effects such as elevated heart रेट and मांसपेशी twitching, but not to the cognitive or arousal प्रभाव of caffeine.
The उपाधि to which caffeine can produce clinically significant physical और दिमागी dependence remains a subject of controversy in the चिकित्सा literature.

Black swan is a 2010 American मनोवैज्ञानिक thriller और हॉरर फिल्मी directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring नताली Portman, Vincent Cassel, and mila Kunis.
the प्लाट revolves around a production of tchaikovsky 's swan झील ballet by a prestigious नई यॉर्क City company.
The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent और नाजुक श्वेत Swan, for which the वचनबद्ध नर्तकी Nina ( Portman ) is a perfect fit, as well as the अंधेरा and कामुक Black Swan, which हैं qualities embodied by the नई arrival Lily ( Kunis ).
Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense दबाव when she finds herself competing for the भाग, causing उसके to lose her tenuous grip on वास्तविकता and descend into a living दुःस्वप्न.
Aronofsky conceived the premise by connecting उसके viewings of a production of Swan झील with an unrealized screenplay परिचय understudies और the notion of being haunted by a double, similar to the लोकगीत surrounding doppelgängers.
Aronofsky cites Fyodor दोस्तोयेव्स्की 's `` The Double `` as another प्रेरणा लिये the film.
the निदेशक भी considered ब्लैक swan a साथी piece to his 2008 फिल्मी the पहलवान, with both films involving demanding प्रदर्शन लिये अलग kinds of art.
He and Portman पहला discussed the प्रोजेक्ट in 2000, और after a ब्रैड attachment to सार्वभौमिक Studios, ब्लैक swan was उत्पादित in New यॉर्क City in 2009 by Fox searchlight तस्वीरें.
Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming, and notable figures इससे the बैले world helped with फिल्मी production to shape the ballet presentation.
The film premiered as the खोलने film for the 67th वेनिस अंतरराष्ट्रीय फिल्मी पर्व on September 1, 2010.
It had a limited release in the United States starting December 3, 2010 and opened देशभर on December 17.
ब्लैक Swan received नाजुक praise upon its release, particularly for Portman 's performance and Aronofsky 's direction, and was a significant बक्सा office success, grossing $ 329 million worldwide.
The film प्राप्त पाँच Academy Award nominations और Portman won the बेहतरीन Actress पुरस्कार for the film, as well as many other Best Actress awards in several guilds and त्यौहार, while Aronofsky was nominated for बेहतरीन Director.

The world’s first ice-calorimeter, प्रयुक्त in the winter of 1782-83, by एंटोनी Lavoisier and pierre-simon Laplace, to determine the heat involved in various chemical changes ; calculations which were आधारित on Joseph ब्लैक ’s prior discovery of latent heat.
These experiments mark the न्यास of thermochemistry.
A calorimeter ( इससे Latin calor, meaning heat ) is an object used for calorimetry, or the process of measuring the ऊष्मा of chemical reactions or physical changes as well as heat capacity.
Differential स्कैनिंग calorimeters, समतापी microcalorimeters, titration calorimeters and accelerated रेट calorimeters हैं among the सबसे common types.
a simple calorimeter just consists of a thermometer संलग्न to a metal container पूरा of water suspended ऊपर a combustion chamber.
to find the enthalpy बदलें per mole of a substance A in a reaction between दो substances A and b, the substances हैं added to a calorimeter and the initial and final temperatures ( before the reaction started और after it has समाप्त ) हैं noted.
Multiplying the temperature change by the द्रव्यमान and specific heat capacities of the substances gives a value for the उर्जा given off or अवशोषित during the reaction.
Dividing the उर्जा बदलें by कैसा many औज़ार of A were उपस्थित देता its enthalpy change of प्रतिक्रिया.
This method is used primarily in academic teaching as it describes the theory of calorimetry.
It does not account for the heat loss through the container or the heat capacity of the thermometer and container itself.
In addition, the ऑब्जेक्ट placed अंदर the calorimeter shows that the objects transferred their heat to the ऊष्मामापी and into the liquid, and the heat absorbed by the calorimeter and the द्रव is equal to the heat दिए off by the metals.
a pair of ग्रीन flip-flops
flip-flops ( also पुकारा zōri, thongs, jandals, or a किस्में of अन्य names throughout the संसार ) are a type of open-toed चन्दन typically worn in casual परिस्थितियों, such as outside or at the beach.
They consist of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a y-shaped strap that passes between the first and दूसरी toes and around either side of the foot.
They may also be held to the पैर with a single strap over the front of the foot rather than a थोंग.
the name `` flip-flop '' originated because of the sound that is made by slapping between the sole of the foot और the floor when walking.
This style of footwear has महरूम worn by the लोगों of many cultures throughout the संसार, originating as early as the ancient Egyptians in 4,000 B.C.
the आधुनिक flip-flop descends from the जापानी zōri, जिससे became popular after संसार War II when soldiers returning to the United States brought उन्हें back.
They became लोकप्रिय in casual जमावट during the 1960s, 1990s, और 2000s, and some varieties have even मिला their रास्ता into अधिक formal attire, despite आलोचना.
The use of flip-flops can result in many pains and injuries, including ankle sprains and broken हड्डियों.
Some individuals जो walk for long periods report pain in the feet, ankles, और lower legs.
the lack of support provided by flip-flops प्रायः results in over-pronation injuries, caused by the foot slipping inwards further than normal.
इस can सीसे to flat feet and tendonitis.
अन्य injuries कि may result are due to the footwear 's open-toed nature, such as stubbed toes, cuts, and bruises.
डॉक्टर recommend purchasing pricier चप्पल with thick-cushioned soles, as खूब as those that have a strap that is not canvas और that आता back almost to the टखने.
the owners of Hanjin Osaka, देखी यहाँ transiting the Panama Canal in 2008, declared सामान्य average following an explosion in the ship 's engine room on.
The law of सामान्य औसत is a legal principle of maritime law according to जिससे all पार्टियों in a समुद्र venture proportionally share any losses resulting इससे a voluntary बलिदान of part of the जलयान or cargo to save the whole in an emergency.
In the exigencies of जोखिमों faced at समुद्र, crew members often have अनमोल little time in जिससे to determine precisely whose cargo they are jettisoning.
Thus, to avoid quarrelling that could waste valuable time, there arose the equitable practice whereby सब the merchants जिनकी cargo landed safely होता be called on to योगदान a portion, based upon a share or प्रतिशत, to the merchant or व्यापारियों जिनकी goods had been tossed overboard to avert imminent peril.
While सामान्य average traces its origins in ancient maritime विधि, still it remains भाग of the admiralty विधि of most countries.
The पहला संहिताकरण of general average was the York Antwerp Rules of 1890.
American companies accepted it in 1949.
General average requires three elements which are clearly stated by Mr. Justice Grier in Barnard v. Adams:
`` 1st.
A common खतरे : a danger in जिससे पोत, cargo and crew all participate ; a danger imminent and apparently 'inevitable, ' except by voluntarily incurring the loss of a portion of the पूरे to save the remainder. ''
`` 2nd. There must be a voluntary jettison, jactus, or casting away, of some portion of the संयुक्त concern लिये the purpose of avoiding this imminent peril, periculi imminentis evitandi causa, or, in other शब्द, a transfer of the peril from the whole to a particular portion of the whole. ''
`` 3rd.
इस attempt to avoid the imminent common peril जरूर be successful ''.
Example Polish कॉल for vaccination against Diphtheria and टेटनस.
A vaccination schedule is a series of vaccinations, including the timing of सब doses, which may be either अनुशंसित or compulsory, depending on the country of residence.
A टीका is an antigenic तैयारी used to produce active immunity to a बीमारी, in order to prevent or reduce the प्रभाव of infection by any natural or `` जंगली '' pathogen.
Many टीके आवश्यकता multiple doses लिये maximum effectiveness, either to produce sufficient initial immune response or to बूस्ट response that fades over समय.
For उदाहरण, tetanus vaccine boosters are often अनुशंसित प्रत्येक 10 years.
टीका schedules हैं developed by governmental agencies or physicians groups to achieve maximum effectiveness using required and recommended टीके for a मोहल्ले while minimizing the क्रमांक of health care system interactions.
Over the पास्ट दो decades, the recommended टीकाकरण schedule has grown rapidly and become अधिक complicated as अनेक new vaccines have महरूम developed.
Some टीके हैं अनुशंसित only in certain क्षेत्रों ( countries, subnational areas, or at-risk populations ) where a disease is common.
लिये instance, पीला ज्वर टीकाकरण is on the routine vaccine schedule of फ्रेंच Guiana, is अनुशंसित in certain regions of Brazil but in the United राज्य is only given to travelers heading to countries with a इतिहास of the disease.
In विकासशील देशों, टीका recommendations also लो into account the स्तर of health परवाह access, the cost of vaccines और issues with vaccine availability and भंडार.
Sample vaccinations schedules discussed by the संसार Health Organization show a developed country using a schedule which extends over the पहला five years of a चाइल्ड 's life and उपयोग vaccines which cost over $ 700 including administration costs while a developing country उपयोग a अनुसूची providing vaccines in the first 9 months of life और costing only $ 25.
इस difference is due to the निम्नतर cost of health care, the lower लागत of many टीके provided to developing nations, और कि अधिक expensive vaccines, प्रायः for less common diseases, are not utilized.
In 1900, the smallpox vaccine was the only one administered to children.
By the early 1950s, children routinely received four टीके, for सुरक्षा against ( डिप्थीरिया, pertussis, टेटनस, polio, and smallpox ), और as many as five गोलियाँ by two years of age.
चूंकि the mid-1980s, अनेक vaccines have been added to the schedule.
, the US Centers for बीमारी Control and Prevention ( CDC ) now अनुशंसा vaccination against at तनिक fourteen diseases.
By two years of आयु, u.S. children प्राप्त as अनेक as 24 vaccine injections, and might receive up to five shots during एक visit to the doctor.
the use of combination टीका products means that,, the United Kingdom 's immunization program consists of 10 injections by the age of two, बल्कि than 25 if vaccination लिये प्रत्येक disease was given as a पृथक इंजेक्शन.

Vitamin d is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible लिये intestinal अवशोषण of कैल्सियम and phosphate.
In इंसानो, the most महत्वपूर्ण सम्बन्धित compounds of vitamin D are vitamin d2 and vitamin D3.
Cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) and ergocalciferol ( vitamin D2 ) are unique as they constitute what we know as vitamin d and can be ingested from the diet and/or supplements.
The body can भी synthesize vitamin D ( इससे cholesterol ) when सूर्य exposure is adequate ( hence its nickname, the `` sunshine vitamin '' ).
Although विटामिन D is commonly पुकारा a vitamin, it is not actually an essential dietary विटामिन in the सख्त sense, as it can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most स्तनधारियों exposed to धूप.
( बिल्लियों and dogs can not synthesize vitamin D efficiently and must receive it in उनके diet. )
An organic chemical compound ( or related set of यौगिकों ) is तभी scientifically called a vitamin when it can नहीं be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must be प्राप्त इससे उनके आहार.
However, as with other compounds commonly called vitamins, विटामिन d थी discovered in an effort to find the dietary substance कि थी lacking in a disease, namely, rickets, the childhood form of osteomalacia.
Additionally, जैसे other यौगिकों called vitamins, in the विकसित संसार विटामिन D is added to स्टेपल foods, ऐसे as milk, to avoid बीमारी due to deficiency.
उपायों of सीरम स्तर reflect endogenous synthesis from एक्सपोज़र to धूप as well as सेवन from the आहार, and it is believed that synthesis may contribute generally to the maintenance of adequate serum concentrations.
The प्रमाण indicates that the संश्लेषण of vitamin D from सूर्य एक्सपोज़र works in a feedback loop कि prevents toxicity but, because of uncertainty about the cancer risk इससे धूप, no recommendations are जारी by the Institute of Medicine, USA, for the राशि of सूर्य एक्सपोज़र required to meet विटामिन D requirements.
Accordingly, the dietary Reference Intakes for विटामिन D assume कि no संश्लेषण occurs और that all of a person 's vitamin D is इससे their diet, हालांकि that will rarely occur in practice.
In the जिगर vitamin D is परिवर्तित to calcidiol, जिससे is also ज्ञात as calcifediol ( इन ), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin d—abbreviated 25 ( oh ) D ; and which is the specific विटामिन D metabolite that is measured in serum to determine a person 's विटामिन d status.
Part of the calcidiol is converted by the kidneys to calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the रक्त, regulating the विशेषज्ञता of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream और promoting the healthy विकास and remodeling of अस्थि.
Calcidiol is also converted to calcitriol बाहर of the गुर्दे for other purposes, ऐसे as the अप्रसार, differentiation and apoptosis of कोशिकाएं ; calcitriol also affects neuromuscular function and सूजन.
परे its उपयोग to prevent osteomalacia or rickets, the प्रमाण for अन्य health effects of vitamin d supplementation in the सामान्य population is inconsistent.
The best प्रमाण of benefit is for bone health and a decrease in mortality in elderly women.

the rows of the तालिका हैं पुकारा अवधि ; the columns of the s-, d-, and p-blocks हैं called groups, with कुछ of these having names such as the हैलोजन्स or the noble gases.
चूंकि, by definition, a periodic table incorporates recurring trends, any such तालिका can be प्रयुक्त to derive relationships between the गुण of the elements and predict the properties of new, yet to be discovered or synthesized, elements.
As a परिणाम, a आवधिक table—whether in the standard form or some other variant—provides a useful फ्रेमवर्क for analyzing chemical behavior, and such tables हैं widely used in chemistry and other sciences.
Although precursors exist, Dmitri mendeleev is generally credited with the publication, in 1869, of the first widely recognized periodic तालिका.
He विकसित उसके table to illustrate periodic रुझान in the properties of the then-known elements.
mendeleev भी predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that होता be expected to fill gaps in this table.
Most of his पूर्वानुमान were proved सही जब the तत्व in question were subsequently discovered.
Mendeleev 's periodic तालिका रै since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further नई तत्व और the विकास of new सैद्धांतिक models to explain chemical behavior.
All elements from परमाणु numbers 1 ( hydrogen ) to 118 ( ununoctium ) have महरूम discovered or synthesized.
The तत्व इससे 1 to 98 ( californium ) have महरूम found to exist naturally, although some are मिला only in trace amounts and were initially खोजा by synthesis in laboratories.
The elements after 98 have only been synthesized in laboratories.
उत्पादन of elements परे ununoctium is होने pursued, with the question of how the आवधिक तालिका may need to be परिवर्धित to accommodate कोई such additions being a पदार्थ of ongoing debate.
Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also महरूम produced in laboratories.

Francesco Albani 's 17th सदी Baptism of मसीह is a typical चित्रण with the sky opening और the Holy Spirit descending as a dove.
The बपतिस्मा of Jesus marks the beginning of उसके पब्लिक ministry.
इस event is recorded in the canonical gospels of मैथ्यू, चिह्नित and Luke.
जॉन 's इन्जील करता नहीं describe Jesus ' बपतिस्मा, but John the Baptist does testify of the other things in.
In the नई वसीयत, John the Baptist preached the बपतिस्मा of repentance for the remission of sins ( ), and घोषित himself a forerunner of he that would baptize `` साथ the Holy Ghost and with आग '' ( ).
In so doing he was preparing the way लिये Jesus.
यीशु came to the जॉर्डन River where he was baptized by जॉन.
The baptismal scene शामिल the आकाश opening, a dove-like descent of the पावन Spirit, and a voice from heaven saying, `` This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. ''
Most modern scholars view the fact that Jesus थी baptized by John as an ऐतिहासिक event to which a ऊँची degree of certainty can be assigned.
साथ with the crucifixion of Jesus most scholars दृश्य it as एक of the दो historically certain facts about him, and प्रायः use it as the starting points for the पढ़ाई of the historical यीशु.
The baptism is one of the पाँच major माइलस्टोन in the इन्जील कथा of the जीवन of Jesus, the others होने the Transfiguration, crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension.
Most Christian denominations view the baptism of Jesus as an important event and a basis for the Christian रीति of बपतिस्मा ( see also ).
In पूर्वी Christianity, Jesus ' baptism is commemorated on 6 January, the feast of Epiphany.

Physically it resembles the other forms of vitamin B12, occurring as dark red crystals that freely रूप cherry-colored transparent solutions in जल.
Vitamin B12, vitamin b12 or विटामिन B-12, भी called cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in the normal कामकाज of the brain और nervous system, and for the formation of blood.
It is one of the eight B vitamins.
it is normally शामिल in the metabolism of every cell of the इंसान body, especially affecting डीएनए synthesis and regulation, लकिन also fatty एसिड संश्लेषण and energy उत्पादन.
Neither fungi, पौधे, nor पशु are capable of producing vitamin b12.
तभी bacteria and archaea have the enzymes जरूरी लिये its synthesis, although many foods हैं a प्राकृतिक सोर्स of B12 because of bacterial symbiosis.
The vitamin is the largest and सबसे structurally complicated vitamin और can be produced industrially only through बैक्टीरियल fermentation-synthesis.
विटामिन b12 consists of a class of chemically related compounds ( vitamers ), all of which have विटामिन activity.
It contains the biochemically rare element cobalt.
Biosynthesis of the मौलिक ढांचा of the vitamin is संपन्नता only by bacteria ( which प्रायः produce hydroxocobalamin ), लकिन परिवर्तन between different forms of the विटामिन can be accomplished in the human body.
A common semi-synthetic form of the vitamin, cyanocobalamin, does not occur in nature, but is produced from bacterial hydroxocobalamin and then used in many pharmaceuticals और पूरक, and as a food additive, because of its stability and lower उत्पादन लागत.
in the body it is परिवर्तित to the human physiological forms methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, leaving behind the cyanide, albeit in minimal विशेषज्ञता.
More recently, hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin can be found in अधिक महंगी pharmacological उत्पाद and खाना पूरक.
the extra utility of these is फिलहाल debated.
विटामिन B12 was discovered from इसके relationship to the disease घातक anemia, जिससे is an autoimmune disease in जिससे parietal कोशिकाएं of the stomach जिम्मेदार for secreting intrinsic factor हैं destroyed.
मूलभूत factor is crucial for the सामान्य absorption of b12, so a lack of intrinsic factor, as देखी in pernicious रक्ताल्पता, causes a vitamin b12 कमियां.

the चलना Liberty half dollar was a silver 50-cent टुकड़ा or हाफ dollar coin जारी by the United States Mint इससे 1916 to 1947 ; it थी designed by Adolph A. Weinman.
in 1915, the नई मिंट Director, Robert W. Woolley, आए to believe that he was नहीं only allowed लकिन जरूरी by law to replace coin designs that था been in उपयोग लिये 25 years.
he therefore began the प्रक्रम of replacing the Barber coinage : dimes, quarters and हाफ dollars, all bearing similar designs by long-time Mint Engraver Charles E. नाई, and first struck in 1892.
woolley had the Commission of ठीक Arts conduct a competition, as a result of which weinman was selected to डिज़ाइन the dime and half dollar.
Weinman 's design of स्वतंत्रता striding towards the सूर्य for the half dollar proved difficult to पूर्ण, and Treasury Secretary विलियम G. McAdoo, जिनकी विभाग included the Mint, considered having Barber बनाएँ उसके अपना डिज़ाइन.
Mint officials were कामयाब in getting Weinman 's डिज़ाइन into उत्पादन, although it never struck very खूब, which may have महरूम a factor in इसके replacement by the Franklin half dollar beginning in 1948.
nevertheless, art historian कॉर्नेलियस Vermeule considered the piece to be among the most beautiful US coins.

Potassium is a chemical element साथ प्रतीक K ( from Neo-Latin kalium ) and atomic number 19.
Elemental पोटैशियम is a soft silvery-white क्षारीय metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and is very reactive with water, generating sufficient ऊष्मा to ignite the hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac flame.
Because potassium and sodium हैं chemically बहुत similar, their लवण were not at पहला differentiated.
The अस्तित्व of multiple elements in उनके salts was suspected from 1702, और this थी proven in 1807 जब potassium और sodium were individually isolated from different salts by electrolysis.
पोटैशियम in nature occurs तभी in ionic salts.
as such, it is मिला dissolved in seawater ( जिससे is 0.04 % पोटैशियम by weight ), और is part of many minerals.
Most industrial chemical अनुप्रयोग of पोटैशियम employ the relatively ऊँची solubility in water of potassium compounds, such as पोटैशियम soaps.
Potassium मेटल has only a few खास applications, being replaced in सबसे chemical reactions with sodium मेटल.
Potassium ions are necessary for the फलन of all living cells.
पोटैशियम ion diffusion is a key mechanism in nerve transmission, और पोटैशियम depletion in animals, सहित humans, results in various cardiac डिस्फंक्शन.
Potassium accumulates in plant cells, and thus fresh fruits and सब्जियां are a good dietary source of it.
Conversely, सबसे plants मगर विशेषज्ञ halophytes are intolerant of salt, and सोडियम is present in them only in low विशेषज्ञता.
इस resulted in potassium first होने isolated from potash, the राख of पौधे, giving the element इसके नाम.
For the same reason, भारी crop production rapidly depletes soils of potassium, और agricultural fertilizers consume 95 % of global potassium chemical उत्पादन.

He was an important पार्षद to Henry VIII of इंग्लैण्ड and was रब Chancellor इससे October 1529 to 16 may 1532.
He was canonized by Pope Pius xi in 1935 as one of the early martyrs of the schism that separated the गिरिजाघर of इंग्लैण्ड इससे Rome in the 16th century.
In 2000, Pope John पॉल II declared him patron of Catholic कूटनीतिज्ञों and politicians.
More was an opponent of the प्रोटोस्टेंट Reformation, in particular of Martin Luther and विलियम टिंडेल.
however, चूंकि 1980, he is भी commemorated by the गिरिजाघर of इंग्लैण्ड as a reformation martyr.
More coined the word `` utopia `` – a नाम he दिया to the आदर्श और काल्पनिक island स्वदेश, the political system of which he described in यूटोपिया, published in 1516.
He opposed the King 's विरह from the Roman Catholic Church और refused to accept him as Supreme Head of the Church of England, a title जिससे had been दिए by parliament through the अधिनियम of Supremacy of 1534.
he was imprisoned in 1534 for his refusal to लो the शपथ required by the First Succession अधिनियम, because the act disparaged Papal Authority and Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon.
in 1535, he थी tried for देशद्रोह, convicted on perjured testimony, and beheaded.
अधिक also helped to originate the phrase `` grasp at straws '' to mean `` desperately trying even useless things '', in his Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation.
intellectuals and statesmen across Europe were stunned by More 's निष्पादन.
Erasmus saluted him as one `` whose आत्मा थी more pure than any हिम, whose genius was such कि England never had and never again will have इसके like ''.
There was a more controversial पक्ष to More 's life, because he advocated the persecution and निष्पादन of protestants who refused to recant their faith.
However, the निर्णय of history रै been largely willing to forgive this in light of the times he lived in and his martyrdom in the Roman Catholic cause.
दो सदियां later Jonathan स्विफ्ट said More was `` the person of the greatest virtue इस kingdom कभी produced '', a sentiment साथ which Samuel Johnson agreed.

Acoustic coupler modem
A modem ( modulator-demodulator ) is a यंत्र that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode डिजिटल सूचना, और also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted सूचना.
The goal is to produce a सिग्नल that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital आंकड़ा.
Modems can be used over any means of transmitting analog signals, इससे light emitting diodes to रेडियो.
the सबसे familiar example is a voice बैंड modem कि turns the डिजिटल data of a निजी कंप्यूटर into modulated electrical signals in the voice frequency range of a telephone चैनल.
ये signals can be transmitted over टेलीफोन lines और demodulated by another modem at the receiver पक्ष to recover the digital data.
Modems are generally classified by the amount of data they can send in a दिए unit of समय, usually expressed in बिट्स per second ( bit/s, or bps ), or bytes प्रति second ( b/s ).
Modems can alternatively be classified by their symbol rate, measured in baud.
the baud unit denotes symbols per second, or the number of times प्रति दूसरी the modem sends a new signal.
For example, the itu V.21 standard used audio आवृत्ति shift keying with two possible बारंबारता corresponding to दो distinct प्रतीकों ( or एक bit per symbol ), to carry 300 bits per second using 300 baud.
by कंट्रास्ट, the original ITU V.22 standard, जिससे was able to transmit and receive चार distinct symbols ( two bits प्रति प्रतीक ), handled 1,200 bit/s by sending 600 symbols per दूसरी ( 600 baud ) using phase shift keying.
The घोषणा of स्वतंत्रता is a बयान adopted by the Continental कॉंग्रेस on July 4, 1776, which घोषित that the thirteen American colonies, तब at war with ग्रेट ब्रिटेन, regarded themselves as independent states, and no longer a part of the British Empire.
Instead they now formed a new nation—the संयुक्त राज्य of अमेरिका.
John Adams थी a नेता in pushing for independence, which थी unanimously approved on जुलाई 2.
A कमेटी had already drafted the formal declaration, to be तैयार when congress voted on स्वतंत्रता.
एडम्स persuaded the कमेटी to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document, which congress would edit to उपज the final version.
The Declaration थी ultimately a formal स्पष्टीकरण of why Congress had voted on July 2 to घोषित स्वतंत्रता इससे Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the अमरीकी क्रांतिकारी युद्ध.
The national birthday, the स्वतंत्रता Day is celebrated on July 4, हालांकि Adams wanted जुलाई 2.
After ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the घोषणा of स्वतंत्रता in अनेक फ़ॉर्म.
It थी initially प्रकाशित as the मुद्रित Dunlap broadside कि थी widely distributed और read to the पब्लिक.
The most famous version of the Declaration, a signed नक़ल कि is popularly regarded as the Declaration of स्वतंत्रता, is displayed at the National अभिलेख in Washington, D.C.
Although the wording of the घोषणा थी स्वीकृत on July 4, the date of इसके signing थी August 2.
The original July 4 United States Declaration of Independence पाण्डुलिपि was खोया while all अन्य नक़ल have महरूम निकला from इस original दस्तावेज़.
the स्त्रोत और निर्वचन of the Declaration have been the विषय of much scholarly पूछताछ.
The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by लिस्टिंग colonial grievances against King जार्ज III, and by asserting certain natural और legal rights, सहित a right of revolution.
Having served its असली purpose in announcing independence, the text of the Declaration was initially ignored after the American Revolution.
Since then, it has आइये to be माना a major statement on human rights, particularly इसके second sentence:
We hold these सच्चाई to be self-evident, that all men are निर्मित बराबर, that they हैं endowed by उनके निर्माता with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
इस has been पुकारा `` one of the best-known वाक्य in the English भाषा '', containing `` the most potent and consequential words in American इतिहास. ''
The passage came to represent a moral मानक to which the United States should strive.
This view थी notably प्रचारित by Abraham Lincoln, who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy, and argued that the घोषणा is a बयान of सिद्धान्त through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted.
It has inspired work for the अधिकारों of marginalized लोगों throughout the world.
The Economy of Greenland can be characterized as छोटी, mixed and vulnerable.
The उपस्थित economy consists of a बिग public सेक्टर and comprehensive विदेशी trade, which रै resulted in an economy साथ अवधि of strong growth, considerable inflation, unemployment problems and extreme dependence on capital inflow from Denmark and उपयोग of outside, mainly Danish, skilled labor.
GDP प्रति capita is similar to the औसत यूरोपीय economies but the अर्थव्यवस्था is critically निर्भर upon substantial support from the Danish government, which supplies about हाफ the revenues of the घर rule government who in फेरे employ about 8,000 Greenlanders out of a labor फ़ोर्स of 40,156 ( jan. 2012 ).
Unemployment nonetheless remains high, साथ the rest of the economy dependent upon demand for exports of shrimp and fish.
Hydrogen is a रासायनिक element साथ प्रतीक H and atomic number 1.
With an atomic weight of ( for hydrogen-1 ), hydrogen is the lightest element and its monatomic रूप ( h1 ) is the सबसे abundant रासायनिक पदार्थ, constituting roughly 75 % of the Universe 's baryonic द्रव्यमान.
Non- remnant stars हैं mainly composed of hydrogen in इसके plasma राज्य.
At standard temperature और pressure, हाइड्रोजन is a colorless, गंधहीन, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic गैस with the आणविक formula h2.
सबसे of the हाइड्रोजन on Earth is in molecules ऐसे as water and सशुल्क compounds क्युकी hydrogen readily फ़ॉर्म covalent compounds with सबसे non-metallic elements.
Hydrogen plays a particularly important भूमिका in acid-base chemistry with अनेक reactions exchanging protons between soluble molecules.
in ionic compounds, it can लो a negative चार्ज ( an anion known as a hydride and लिखा as h− ), or as a positively charged species H+.
the latter cation is written as हालांकि रचित of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds सदा occur as more complex species.
The most common isotope of hydrogen is protium ( name rarely used, symbol 1h ) with a सिंगल proton and no neutrons.
as the simplest atom known, the hydrogen atom रै been of theoretical use.
लिये example, as the only neutral atom with an analytic solution to the Schrödinger समीकरण, the पढ़ाई of the energetics और bonding of the हाइड्रोजन अणु played a key भूमिका in the development of quantum यांत्रिकी.
हाइड्रोजन गैस was first artificially produced in the early 16th century, via the mixing of metals with acids.
in 1766–81, हेनरी Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen गैस was a discrete पदार्थ, and that it produces water when burned, a property जिससे later gave it इसके name : in Greek, हाइड्रोजन अर्थात् `` water-former ''.
Industrial production is मुख्यतः इससे the steam reforming of प्राकृतिक gas, and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production विधि like the electrolysis of water.
Most hydrogen is employed निकट its production site, with the दो largest uses being fossil fuel processing ( e.g., hydrocracking ) and अमोनिया production, mostly for the fertilizer market.

स्मारक of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler in प्राग
Tycho Brahe ( 14 December 154624 अक्तूबर 1601 ), born tyge Ottesen Brahe, थी a Danish nobleman known for उसके accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations.
He थी born in Scania, then भाग of डेनमार्क, now part of modern-day Sweden.
Tycho was well known in his आजीवन as an astronomer and alchemist.
In उसके De nova stella ( on the new star ) of 1573, he refuted the Aristotelian belief in an अपरिवर्तनशील celestial realm.
His precise measurements indicated that `` new सितारों, '' ( stellae novae, अभी ज्ञात as supernovae ) in particular that of 1572, lacked the parallax expected in sub-lunar phenomena, and were therefore not `` atmospheric '' tailless धूमकेतुओं as previously believed, but were ऊपर the atmosphere and चंद्रमा.
Using similar measurements he दिखाया कि comets were also नहीं वायुमंडलीय phenomena, as previously thought, and must pass through the supposedly `` immutable '' celestial spheres.
As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of the Copernican system साथ the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe, the Tychonic system.
furthermore, he थी the last of the major naked eye astronomers, working without telescopes लिये उसके observations.
Tycho Brahe was granted an estate on the island of hven and the funding to build the uraniborg, an early research संस्थान, जहाँ he निर्मित large खगोलीय instruments और took अनेक careful measurements, और later Stjerneborg, भूमिगत, when he discovered that his instruments in the former यहूद नहीं fear steady.
On the island ( on जिससे he demonstrated निरंकुश character and बर्ताव toward the residents ) he founded manufactories such as paper-making to provide सामग्री for printing उसके results.
After disagreements with the new Danish किंग ईसाई IV in 1597, he थी आमंत्रित by the Bohemian king and पावन Roman emperor Rudolph ii to Prague, where he became the official imperial astronomer.
He built the new observatory at Benátky nad jizerou.
Here, from 1600 जबतक his death in 1601, he was assisted by Johannes Kepler who बाद प्रयुक्त Tycho 's astronomical आंकड़ा to develop कॅप्लर 's कानून of ग्रहीय motion.
Guro District ( Guro-gu ) is a district of Seoul, South Korea, जिससे was separated from Yeongdeungpo District on April 1, 1980.
Located in the southwestern part of the city, where besides Yangcheon ज़िला और Geumcheon District Guro District रै an महत्वपूर्ण position as a transport कड़ी which contains railroads, जमीन routes इससे the rest of Seoul to the south of the देश.
The Gyeongbu और Gyeongin railway lines connect Seoul to Busan and इंचियोन.

the name Guro originates इससे the legend कि नौ ( ) old men ( Korean : ro ) enjoyed longevity in the district.
A digital industrial complex is located in Guro District.
The Guro Digital Industrial Complex, which निभाई a leading industrial भूमिका mainly with वस्त्र manufacturing, dressmaking and other labour-intensive industries in 1967, has been rapidly changed into an IT industrial complex.
This complex played a pivotal भूमिका in the economic growth of the South Korea 's development era, referred to as the `` चमत्कार on the हान River ``, and also contributed 10 percent of national निर्यात in the 1970s.
Twenty-one प्रतिशत of the कुल area of Guro District is a restricted zone to be used as a greenbelt with the only arboretum in सियोल.
The zone is changing into a lively district as large labour-intensive factories are moving from the area and the council is विकासशील what it terms इसके four zones.
An `` e-government `` system based on this hosted the international e-participation forum on फ़रवरी 7–9, 2007, with the भागीदारी of more than thirty-seven countries.

Many लोगों were शामिल in the आविष्कार of radio as we now know it.
Several possible methods of बेतार संचार were considered, including inductive और capacitive प्रेरण and transmission through the मैदान, however the method used लिये radio today exclusively involves the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves.
After early अटकलें on the subject, experimental work on the connection between electricity और चुंबकत्व began around 1820 साथ the कार्य of Hans ईसाई Ørsted and continued with the कार्य of André-Marie Ampère, Joseph Henry, and Michael Faraday.
ये investigations culminated in the complete theory of विद्युत्चुम्बकत्व developed by James Clerk Maxwell.
This theory described the theoretical आधार of the propagation of electromagnetic waves.
बाद Maxwell 's theory थी published अनेक people experimented साथ wireless संचार, कुछ intentionally using Maxwell 's theory some नहीं.
It is considered likely that the first intentional transmission of a सिग्नल by अर्थात् of इलेक्ट्रोमैग्नेटिक waves was performed by दाउद Edward Hughes around 1880, हालांकि this थी considered to be प्रेरण at the time.
The पहला systematic and unequivocal हस्तांतरण of EM waves was performed by heinrich Rudolf Hertz और described in papers published in 1887 और 1890.
Hertz famously considered these results as being of little practical मान.
After Hertz 's work अनेक people were involved in the विकास of components and सिद्धान्त involved with the हस्तांतरण and reception of इलेक्ट्रोमैग्नेटिक लहरें.
Others, notably Guglielmo मार्कोनी, were चिंतित with व्यावहारिक improvements and the commercial application of radio to wireless telegraphy.
बाद on Reginald A. Fessenden became the first to भेजें an ऑडियो signal by अर्थात् of electromagnetic waves.
Scurvy is a बीमारी resulting from a deficiency of विटामिन C, जिससे is required for the संश्लेषण of collagen in इंसानो.
The chemical name लिये विटामिन c, ascorbic एसिड, is निकला from the Latin name of स्कर्वी, scorbutus, which भी provides the क्रियाशील scorbutic ( `` of, characterized by or having to do साथ scurvy '' ).
Scurvy often presents itself initially as लक्षण of malaise and lethargy, followed by formation of spots on the स्किन, spongy मसूड़ों, and bleeding from the श्लेष्मक membranes.
Spots हैं सबसे abundant on the thighs और टाँगे, and a व्यक्ति साथ the ailment looks पाले, feels उदास, and is partially immobilized.
As scurvy advances, there can be open, suppurating wounds, loss of teeth, jaundice, ज्वर, neuropathy and death.
स्कर्वी was at one time common among sailors, pirates और others aboard ships at समुद्र longer than perishable फल and सब्जियां could be stored ( subsisting बजाय तभी on cured and salted meats and dried दाने ) and by सैनिको similarly वंचित of these foods लिये extended periods.
It was described by हिपोक्रेटिस ( c. 460 BC–c. 380 bc ), and herbal cures for स्कर्वी have महरूम known in many देशी cultures चूंकि प्रागितिहास.
Scurvy थी one of the limiting factors of marine travel, प्रायः killing विशाल numbers of the passengers and crew on long-distance voyages.
This became a significant issue in Europe from the शुरूआत of the आधुनिक era in the Age of डिस्कवरी in the 15th सदी, continuing to खेल a significant role through संसार War I in the 20th century.
While today scurvy is known to be caused by a nutritional deficiency, until the अलगाव of vitamin c और direct प्रमाण of इसके link to scurvy in 1932, numerous theories और treatments were प्रस्तावित, often on छोटी or no प्रायोगिक data.
This inconsistency is attributed to the lack of vitamin c as a distinct अवधारणा, an अक्षमता to reliably कड़ी different foods ( notably present in भैस citrus, watercress, and अंग मांस ) to scurvy.
An अतिरिक्त अवधारणा जरूरी to समझे scurvy was the degradation of vitamin c by एक्सपोज़र to air और तांबे and other transition metal salts such as those of iron, यूँ बदलना the links of भोजन to scurvy over समय.
Treatment by fresh food, particularly citrus fruit, was periodically implemented, as it था महरूम चूंकि antiquity.
However until the 1930s, उपचार was असंगत, with many ineffective treatments used into the 20th century.
It was a Scottish सर्जन in the royal नेवी, James lind who first proved it could be treated with citrus fruit in experiments he described in his 1753 book, A Treatise of the Scurvy, though उसके advice was नहीं implemented by the Royal Navy लिये अनेक decades.
In infants, स्कर्वी is sometimes referred to as Barlow 's disease, named बाद Sir Thomas Barlow, a British physician जो वर्णित it.
However, Barlow 's disease may भी refer to mitral valve prolapse.
Other eponyms लिये scurvy शामिल Moeller 's disease and Cheadle 's disease.
Scurvy करता not occur in most animals because they can synthesize their own vitamin C.
However, इंसानो और other higher primates ( the simians - monkeys और apes - और tarsiers ), guinea pigs, most or सब bats, और कुछ species of birds और मछली lack an enzyme ( L-gulonolactone oxidase ) necessary for such synthesis और must obtain vitamin C through their diet.
विटामिन C is फैली in संयंत्र tissues, साथ विशेषकर high concentrations occurring in citrus fruits ( संतरे, lemons, limes, grapefruits ), tomatoes, आलू, cabbages, and green peppers.
आयरन is a रासायनिक element with the symbol Fe ( इससे ) and atomic number 26.
It is a metal in the पहला transition series.
it is the सबसे आम element ( by mass ) forming the planet Earth as a whole, forming much of Earth 's बाहरी and inner core.
It is the चौथी सबसे common element in the Earth 's crust.
Iron 's बहुत आम presence in rocky planets like धरती is due to its abundant production as a result of fusion in high-mass stars, जहाँ the production of nickel-56 ( which decays to the most आम isotope of आयरन ) is the पिछला nuclear fusion प्रतिक्रिया कि is exothermic.
This causes radioactive nickel to become the पिछला तत्व to be produced पहले पतन of a supernova leads to the explosive events that scatter इस precursor radionuclide of iron abundantly into स्पेस.
Like other group 8 elements, आयरन exists in a wide range of oxidation states, −2 to +6, हालांकि +2 and +3 are the सबसे common.
elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to ऑक्सीजन and water.
Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated आयरन oxides, commonly ज्ञात as rust.
Unlike many other धातुओं जिससे form passivating oxide परतों, iron oxides occupy more आवाज़ than iron metal, और thus आयरन आक्साइड flake off and expose fresh surfaces for corrosion.
Iron metal has been प्रयुक्त since प्राचीन times, though copper alloys, which have निम्नतर melting temperatures, were used first in history.
Pure iron is soft ( softer than एल्युमिनियम ), but is unobtainable by smelting.
The material is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities from the smelting process, such as carbon.
A certain proportion of कार्बन ( between 0.002 % और 2.1 % ) produces steel, which may be up to 1000 टाइम्स harder than pure iron.
crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by कोक to pig iron, जिससे has a high कार्बन content.
Further refinement with ऑक्सीजन reduces the carbon सामग्री to the सही proportion to मेक स्टील.
Steels and कम carbon iron alloys साथ अन्य metals ( alloy steels ) are by दूर the सबसे common metals in औद्योगिक उपयोग, due to उनके great range of desirable properties and the abundance of iron.
आयरन रासायनिक compounds, जिससे include ferrous and ferric compounds, have many uses.
Iron ऑक्साइड mixed साथ aluminium चूर्ण can be ignited to बनाएँ a थर्माइट reaction, प्रयुक्त in welding and सुथरा ores.
It फ़ॉर्म binary compounds with the halogens and the chalcogens.
among its organometallic compounds is ferrocene, the first sandwich compound खोजा.
Iron plays an महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका in biology, forming देवालय with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin और myoglobin ; these दो compounds are common oxygen transport प्रोटीन in vertebrates.
Iron is भी the metal used at the active site of many important redox एंजाइमों dealing with cellular respiration और ऑक्सीकरण और reduction in पौधे और पशु.

Many colonists considered it a violation of their rights as Englishmen to be taxed बगैर उनके consent —consent that only the औपनिवेशिक legislatures could grant.
Colonial assemblies भेजा petitions and विरोध.
The स्टैम्प Act कॉंग्रेस held in New York City, reflecting the पहला significant संयुक्त colonial response to any British measure, भी petitioned Parliament and the King.
लोकल protest groups, led by औपनिवेशिक merchants and landowners, established connections through पत्राचार कि created a loose coalition that extended from नई England to Georgia.
Protests and demonstrations initiated by the Sons of Liberty प्रायः turned हिंसक and destructive as the masses became involved.
बहुत soon सब stamp tax वितरकों were intimidated into resigning their commissions, और the tax was never effectively collected.
Opposition to the Stamp Act was not limited to the colonies.
British merchants and manufacturers, whose निर्यात to the colonies were threatened by औपनिवेशिक economic problems exacerbated by the tax, also pressured Parliament.
The Act was repealed on March 18, 1766 as a matter of expedience, but Parliament affirmed its power to legislate for the colonies “in all cases whatsoever” by also passing the declaratory Act.
वहीँ followed a श्रेणी of new taxes and regulations, likewise opposed by the colonists.
The episode played a प्रमुख role in defining the grievances और enabling the organized colonial resistance कि led to the अमरीकी Revolution in 1775.

`` PT '' is the US hull classification symbol for `` Patrol Torpedo ''.
the pt boat squadrons were nicknamed `` the mosquito fleet ''.
the Japanese पुकारा them `` शैतान Boats ''.
The original pre– World युद्ध I torpedo नौकाएँ were designed with `` displacement '' hulls.
वे विस्थापित up to 300 tons and the top गति थी.
The PT boats used in World War ii were built using the planing -type hull form developed लिये racing boats.
They were much smaller ( 30–75 टन ) और faster ( 35–40 knots ).
Both प्रकार were designed to strike at larger warships with torpedoes, using relatively ऊँची speed to get close, and small आकार to avoid होने spotted और hit by gunfire.

Frequently, in जोड to the रोज़ or sometimes instead of it, angle markings in डिग्री are shown on the compass.
North corresponds to zero डिग्री, and the angles बढ़ाएँ clockwise, so east is 90 डिग्री, south is 180, और west is 270.
ये numbers allow the compass to show azimuths or बियरिंग, which हैं commonly stated in this संकेतन.

थर्मल comfort is the condition of दिमाग that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective मूल्यांकन ( ANSI / ASHRAE Standard 55 ).
Maintaining this standard of thermal comfort for occupants of इमारतें or अन्य enclosures is एक of the important goals of HVAC ( heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ) डिज़ाइन engineers.
The पूर्वानुमानित औसत Vote ( PMV ) model स्टैंड among the most पहचाना थर्मल सुकून models.
It was developed using principles of heat balance and प्रायोगिक आंकड़ा collected in a नियंत्रित climate chamber अंतर्गत steady राज्य शर्तें.
क्युकी the PMV model थी derived from data collected in a controlled जलवायु, it is not suitable for applications in naturally ventilated स्पेसेस which often have high स्तर of एयर movement.
This shortcoming motivated the development of a परिवार of empirical statistical models of thermal comfort in naturally ventilated spaces ज्ञात as adaptive models.
Adaptive मॉडल of thermal comfort consider occupants as dynamically interacting with उनके environment, and controlling their thermal comfort by means of clothing or window-opening and closing.
This is in contrast to thermal comfort in sealed buildings, in which occupants experience the environment passively.
Thermal comfort is प्रभावित by ऊष्मा conduction, convection, radiation, और evaporative heat loss.
Thermal सुकून is maintained when the heat उत्पन्न by human चयापचय is अनुमत to dissipate, thus maintaining thermal equilibrium साथ the surroundings.
It has been long recognized that the sensation of अहसास hot or cold is not just निर्भर on एयर temperature अलोन.
थर्मल comfort calculations according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 can be freely performed साथ the CBE Thermal Comfort Tool for ASHRAE-55.

Of these, 663,035 live in the Spanish part of the बास्क country and the remaining 51,100 live in the French part.
In academic discussions of the distribution of Basque in स्पेन और France, it is customary to refer to three ancient प्रांतों in फ़्रांस and four स्पेनी प्रांतों.
Native अध्यक्षों हैं concentrated in a contiguous क्षेत्रफल सहित parts of the स्पेनी autonomous समुदायों of the बास्क Country and नावारा और in the पश्चिमी half of the फ्रेंच département of Pyrénées-Atlantiques.
the Basque Autonomous Community is an administrative एंटिटी within the binational ethnographic बास्क Country incorporating the परंपरागत Spanish provinces of Biscay, gipuzkoa, और álava, which retain their existence as politico-administrative विभाजन.
