The legal defense of set-off ( above ) was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person ( `` Party A '' ) who owed money to another ( `` Party B '' ) could be sent to debtors prison, despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A.
The law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court.
Upon judgment, both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing ( e.g. If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105, the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A ).
Set-off can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that, where a party defaults, the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished.
In certain jurisdictions ( including the UK ), set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company.
This means that, for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company, mutual debts are set-off against each other, and then either the bankrupt 's creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid, depending on which side owed the most.
This has been criticized as an undeclared security interest that violates the principle of pari passu.
The alternative, where a creditor has to pay all its debts, but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get, poses the danger of 'knock-on ' insolvencies.
The right to set off is particularly important when reporting a bank 's exposures to regulatory authorities.
The situation where a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower ( and is therefore exposed, because there is a risk that the borrower might default thereby leading to the loss of the bank 's or its depositors ' money ) is thus replaced ( where the bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower ) with an exposure of the money lent minus the value of the security taken.

Conventional PCI ( PCI is an initialism formed from Peripheral Component Interconnect, part of the PCI Local Bus standard and often shortened to just PCI ) is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer.
The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus, but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor.
Devices connected to the bus appear to the processor to be connected directly to the processor bus, and are assigned addresses in the processor 's address space.
Attached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself, called a planar device in the PCI specification, or an expansion card that fits into a slot.
The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles, where it displaced the combination of ISA plus one VESA Local Bus as the bus configuration.
It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types.
PCI and PCI-X are being replaced by PCI Express, but, most motherboards are still made with one or more PCI slots, which are sufficient for many uses.
The PCI specification covers the physical size of the bus ( including the size and spacing of the circuit board edge electrical contacts ), electrical characteristics, bus timing, and protocols.
The specification can be purchased from the PCI Special Interest Group ( PCI-SIG ).
Typical PCI cards used in PCs include : network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as USB or serial, TV tuner cards and disk controllers.
PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards, until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI ; the preferred interface for video cards became AGP, and then PCI Express.
PCI video cards remain available for use with old PCs without AGP or PCI Express slots.
Many devices previously provided on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in universal serial bus and PCI Express versions.
Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline xanthine alkaloid that acts as a stimulant drug.
Caffeine is found in varying quantities in the seeds, leaves, and fruit of some plants, where it acts as a natural pesticide that paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding on the plants, as well as enhancing the reward memory of pollinators.
It is most commonly consumed by humans in infusions extracted from the seed of the coffee plant and the leaves of the tea bush, as well as from various foods and drinks containing products derived from the kola nut.
Other sources include yerba maté, guarana berries, guayusa, and the yaupon holly.
In humans, caffeine acts as a central nervous system stimulant, temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness.
It is the world 's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world.
Beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks, enjoy great popularity.
In North America, 90 % of adults consume caffeine daily.
Part of the reason caffeine is classified by the Food and Drug Administration as GRAS ( generally recognized as safe ) is that toxic doses ( over 10 grams ) are much higher than typically used doses ( less than 500 milligrams ).
Ordinary consumption can have low health risks, even when carried on for years – there may be a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinsons Disease, and certain types of cancer.
Caffeine can have both positive and negative effects on anxiety disorders.
Some people experience sleep disruption if they consume caffeine, especially during the evening hours, but others show little disturbance and the effect of caffeine on sleep is highly variable.
Evidence of a risk to pregnancy is equivocal, but some authorities have concluded that prudent advice is for pregnant women to limit consumption to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less.
The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200 mg per day in pregnant women.
Caffeine has pressor and mild diuretic effects when administered to people who are not used to it, but regular users develop a tolerance to this effect, and studies have generally failed to support the common notion that ordinary consumption contributes significantly to dehydration.
With heavy use, tolerance develops rapidly to autonomic effects such as elevated heart rate and muscle twitching, but not to the cognitive or arousal effects of caffeine.
The degree to which caffeine can produce clinically significant physical and mental dependence remains a subject of controversy in the medical literature.

World map of passenger cars per 1000 people
An automobile, autocar, motor car or car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transporting passengers, which also carries its own engine or motor.
Most definitions of the term specify that automobiles are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods.
The term motorcar has also been used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage.
These locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems.
It was estimated in 2010 that the number of automobiles had risen to over 1 billion vehicles, up from the 500 million of 1986.
The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China and India.
John Fitzgerald `` Jack '' Kennedy ( May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963 ), often referred to by his initials JFK, was the 35th President of the United States, serving from 1961 until his death in 1963.
After military service as commander of the Motor Torpedo Boats PT-109 and PT-59 during World War II in the South Pacific, Kennedy represented Massachusetts ' 11th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953 as a Democrat.
Thereafter, he served in the U.S. Senate from 1953 until 1960.
Kennedy defeated Vice President and Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. presidential election.
At 43 years of age, he is the youngest to have been elected to the office, the second-youngest President ( after Theodore Roosevelt ), and the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president.
A Catholic, Kennedy is the only non- Protestant president, and is the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize.
Events during his presidency included the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the building of the Berlin Wall, the Space Race, the African-American Civil Rights Movement, and early stages of the Vietnam War.
Therein, Kennedy increased the number of military advisers, special operation forces, and helicopters in an effort to curb the spread of communism in South East Asia.
The Kennedy administration adopted the policy of the Strategic Hamlet Program which was implemented by the South Vietnamese government.
It involved certain forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese from the northern and southern communist insurgents.
Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas.
Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the crime, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later, before a trial could take place.
The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin.
However, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations ( HSCA ) concluded that those investigations were flawed and that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy.
However, ABC News in their investigation, The Kennedy Assassination : Beyond Conspiracy, confirmed the findings of the Warren Commission ; having concluded Oswald acted alone.
Kennedy 's controversial Department of Defense TFX fighter bomber program led to a Congressional investigation that lasted from 1963 to 1970.
Since the 1960s information concerning Kennedy 's private life has come to light.
Details of Kennedy 's health problems in which he struggled have become better known, especially since the 1990s.
Although initially kept secret from the general public, reports of Kennedy 's philandering have garnered much press.
Kennedy ranks highly in public opinion ratings of U.S. presidents.

A Fire Alarm Control Panel ( FACP ), or Fire Alarm Control Unit ( FACU ), is the controlling component of a Fire Alarm System.
The panel receives information from environmental sensors designed to detect changes associated with fire, monitors their operational integrity and provides for automatic control of equipment, and transmission of information necessary to prepare the facility for fire based on a predetermined sequence.
The panel may also supply electrical energy to operate any associated sensor, control, transmitter, or relay.
There are four basic types of panels : coded panels, conventional panels, addressable panels, and multiplex systems.

Black Swan is a 2010 American psychological thriller and horror film directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, and Mila Kunis.
The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake ballet by a prestigious New York City company.
The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina ( Portman ) is a perfect fit, as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities embodied by the new arrival Lily ( Kunis ).
Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare.
Aronofsky conceived the premise by connecting his viewings of a production of Swan Lake with an unrealized screenplay about understudies and the notion of being haunted by a double, similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers.
Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's `` The Double `` as another inspiration for the film.
The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to his 2008 film The Wrestler, with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art.
He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios, Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures.
Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming, and notable figures from the ballet world helped with film production to shape the ballet presentation.
The film premiered as the opening film for the 67th Venice International Film Festival on September 1, 2010.
It had a limited release in the United States starting December 3, 2010 and opened nationwide on December 17.
Black Swan received critical praise upon its release, particularly for Portman 's performance and Aronofsky 's direction, and was a significant box office success, grossing $ 329 million worldwide.
The film received five Academy Award nominations and Portman won the Best Actress award for the film, as well as many other Best Actress awards in several guilds and festivals, while Aronofsky was nominated for Best Director.
In addition, the film itself received a nomination for Best Picture.
The world’s first ice-calorimeter, used in the winter of 1782-83, by Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace, to determine the heat involved in various chemical changes ; calculations which were based on Joseph Black ’s prior discovery of latent heat.
These experiments mark the foundation of thermochemistry.
A calorimeter ( from Latin calor, meaning heat ) is an object used for calorimetry, or the process of measuring the heat of chemical reactions or physical changes as well as heat capacity.
Differential scanning calorimeters, isothermal microcalorimeters, titration calorimeters and accelerated rate calorimeters are among the most common types.
A simple calorimeter just consists of a thermometer attached to a metal container full of water suspended above a combustion chamber.
To find the enthalpy change per mole of a substance A in a reaction between two substances A and B, the substances are added to a calorimeter and the initial and final temperatures ( before the reaction started and after it has finished ) are noted.
Multiplying the temperature change by the mass and specific heat capacities of the substances gives a value for the energy given off or absorbed during the reaction.
Dividing the energy change by how many moles of A were present gives its enthalpy change of reaction.
This method is used primarily in academic teaching as it describes the theory of calorimetry.
It does not account for the heat loss through the container or the heat capacity of the thermometer and container itself.
In addition, the object placed inside the calorimeter shows that the objects transferred their heat to the calorimeter and into the liquid, and the heat absorbed by the calorimeter and the liquid is equal to the heat given off by the metals.
A pair of green flip-flops
Flip-flops ( also called zōri, thongs, jandals, or a variety of other names throughout the world ) are a type of open-toed sandal typically worn in casual situations, such as outside or at the beach.
They consist of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a Y-shaped strap that passes between the first and second toes and around either side of the foot.
They may also be held to the foot with a single strap over the front of the foot rather than a thong.
The name `` flip-flop '' originated because of the sound that is made by slapping between the sole of the foot and the floor when walking.
This style of footwear has been worn by the people of many cultures throughout the world, originating as early as the ancient Egyptians in 4,000 B.C.
The modern flip-flop descends from the Japanese zōri, which became popular after World War II when soldiers returning to the United States brought them back.
They became popular in casual settings during the 1960s, 1990s, and 2000s, and some varieties have even found their way into more formal attire, despite criticism.
The use of flip-flops can result in many pains and injuries, including ankle sprains and broken bones.
Some individuals who walk for long periods report pain in the feet, ankles, and lower legs.
The lack of support provided by flip-flops often results in over-pronation injuries, caused by the foot slipping inwards further than normal.
This can lead to flat feet and tendonitis.
Other injuries that may result are due to the footwear 's open-toed nature, such as stubbed toes, cuts, and bruises.
Doctors recommend purchasing pricier sandals with thick-cushioned soles, as well as those that have a strap that is not canvas and that comes back almost to the ankle.
The owners of Hanjin Osaka, seen here transiting the Panama Canal in 2008, declared general average following an explosion in the ship 's engine room on.
The law of general average is a legal principle of maritime law according to which all parties in a sea venture proportionally share any losses resulting from a voluntary sacrifice of part of the ship or cargo to save the whole in an emergency.
In the exigencies of hazards faced at sea, crew members often have precious little time in which to determine precisely whose cargo they are jettisoning.
Thus, to avoid quarrelling that could waste valuable time, there arose the equitable practice whereby all the merchants whose cargo landed safely would be called on to contribute a portion, based upon a share or percentage, to the merchant or merchants whose goods had been tossed overboard to avert imminent peril.
While general average traces its origins in ancient maritime law, still it remains part of the admiralty law of most countries.
The first codification of general average was the York Antwerp Rules of 1890.
American companies accepted it in 1949.
General average requires three elements which are clearly stated by Mr. Justice Grier in Barnard v. Adams:
`` 1st.
A common danger : a danger in which vessel, cargo and crew all participate ; a danger imminent and apparently 'inevitable, ' except by voluntarily incurring the loss of a portion of the whole to save the remainder. ''
`` 2nd. There must be a voluntary jettison, jactus, or casting away, of some portion of the joint concern for the purpose of avoiding this imminent peril, periculi imminentis evitandi causa, or, in other words, a transfer of the peril from the whole to a particular portion of the whole. ''
`` 3rd.
This attempt to avoid the imminent common peril must be successful ''.
Example Polish call for vaccination against Diphtheria and Tetanus.
A vaccination schedule is a series of vaccinations, including the timing of all doses, which may be either recommended or compulsory, depending on the country of residence.
A vaccine is an antigenic preparation used to produce active immunity to a disease, in order to prevent or reduce the effects of infection by any natural or `` wild '' pathogen.
Many vaccines require multiple doses for maximum effectiveness, either to produce sufficient initial immune response or to boost response that fades over time.
For example, tetanus vaccine boosters are often recommended every 10 years.
Vaccine schedules are developed by governmental agencies or physicians groups to achieve maximum effectiveness using required and recommended vaccines for a locality while minimizing the number of health care system interactions.
Over the past two decades, the recommended vaccination schedule has grown rapidly and become more complicated as many new vaccines have been developed.
Some vaccines are recommended only in certain areas ( countries, subnational areas, or at-risk populations ) where a disease is common.
For instance, yellow fever vaccination is on the routine vaccine schedule of French Guiana, is recommended in certain regions of Brazil but in the United States is only given to travelers heading to countries with a history of the disease.
In developing countries, vaccine recommendations also take into account the level of health care access, the cost of vaccines and issues with vaccine availability and storage.
Sample vaccinations schedules discussed by the World Health Organization show a developed country using a schedule which extends over the first five years of a child 's life and uses vaccines which cost over $ 700 including administration costs while a developing country uses a schedule providing vaccines in the first 9 months of life and costing only $ 25.
This difference is due to the lower cost of health care, the lower cost of many vaccines provided to developing nations, and that more expensive vaccines, often for less common diseases, are not utilized.
In 1900, the smallpox vaccine was the only one administered to children.
By the early 1950s, children routinely received four vaccines, for protection against ( diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, and smallpox ), and as many as five shots by two years of age.
Since the mid-1980s, many vaccines have been added to the schedule.
, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) now recommends vaccination against at least fourteen diseases.
By two years of age, U.S. children receive as many as 24 vaccine injections, and might receive up to five shots during one visit to the doctor.
The use of combination vaccine products means that,, the United Kingdom 's immunization program consists of 10 injections by the age of two, rather than 25 if vaccination for each disease was given as a separate injection.

The Trinidad and Tobago Carnival is an annual event held on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, and is well known for participant 's colorful costumes and exuberant celebrations.
Carnival in Trinidad and Tobago is the most significant event on the islands ' cultural and tourism calendar, with numerous cultural events running in the lead up to the street parade on Carnival Monday and Tuesday.
It is said that if the islanders are not celebrating it, then they are preparing for it, while reminiscing about the past year 's festival.
The heart of the musical celebration has been calypso ; recently soca has replaced calypso as the most celebrated type of music.
Costumes, stickfighting and limbo competitions are also important components of the festival.
Carnival as it is celebrated in Trinidad and Tobago is also celebrated in cities worldwide.
These including Toronto 's Caribana, Miami 's Miami Carnival, Houston Carifest, London 's Notting Hill Carnival as well as New York City 's Labor Day Carnival to name a few.
Carnival was created when West African slaves mimicked their French owners who where known for their lavish costumes balls.
Forbidden to partake in these festivities and confined to their quarters, slaves combined elements from their own cultures to their master 's fete.
Hence the creation of characters such as Jab Jab or Jab Molassie ( Devils ), Midnight Robbers, Imps, Lagahroo, Soucouyant, La Diablesse and Demons.
With the abolition of slavery in 1838, freed Africans took their version of Carnival to the streets through expression of drums, riddim sections like tamboo bamboo and as each new immigrant population entered Trinidad, Carnival evolved into what we know today.
The city of Chicago, Illinois held a nonpartisan mayoral election on Tuesday, February 22, 2011.
Incumbent Mayor Richard M. Daley, a member of the Democratic Party who had been in office since 1989, did not seek a seventh term as mayor.
Candidates needed to collect 12,500 petition signatures by November 22, 2010 to qualify for a place on the ballot.
April 5, 2011 was scheduled to be a runoff election date if no candidate received an absolute majority.
Rahm Emanuel won the race for mayor with more than 55 % of the vote.
He was inaugurated on May 16, 2011.
`` Pumped Up Kicks '' is a song by American indie pop band Foster the People.
It was released as the group 's debut single in September 2010, and the following year was included on their EP Foster the People and their debut album Torches.
`` Pumped Up Kicks '' became the group 's breakthrough hit and was one of the most popular songs of 2011.
The song was written and recorded by frontman Mark Foster while he was working as a commercial jingle writer.
Contrasting with the upbeat musical composition, the lyrics describe the homicidal thoughts of a troubled youth.
The track received considerable attention after it was posted online in 2010 as a free download, and it helped the group garner a multi-album record deal with Columbia Records imprint Startime International.
`` Pumped Up Kicks '' proved to be a sleeper hit ; in 2011, after receiving significant airplay on modern rock stations, the song crossed-over onto contemporary hit radio stations.
The song spent eight consecutive weeks at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States, making it the first Billboard Alternative Songs number-one single to crack the U.S. top 5 since Kings of Leon 's `` Use Somebody `` in 2009.
The song was widely praised by critics, and it has been licensed for use in a wide range of popular media since its release.
`` Pumped Up Kicks '' received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.
The State Fair of West Virginia is an annual state fair for West Virginia.
It is held annually in mid-August on the State Fairgrounds in Fairlea, near Lewisburg, West Virginia in the southeastern part of the state.
The State Fairgrounds consists of a large open field for carnivals and exhibitions, a horse track, grandstands, and several exhibition buildings.
Free parking is provided adjacent to the fairgrounds and, until 2006, free camping was also available in a large field with running-water toilets and showers, but no hookups.
Campers are now charged a small fee.
The White House, the president 's official residence and center of the administration
Under the United States Constitution, the President of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States.
As chief of the executive branch and head of the federal government as a whole, the presidency is the highest political office in the United States by influence and recognition.
The president is also the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.
The president is indirectly elected to a four-year term by an Electoral College ( or by the House of Representatives should the Electoral College fail to award an absolute majority of votes to any person ).
Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected President more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.
Upon the death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the Vice President assumes the office.
The President must be at least 35 years of age and a `` natural born '' citizen of the United States.
This list includes only those persons who were sworn into office as president following the ratification of the United States Constitution, which took effect on March 4, 1789.
For American leaders before this ratification, see President of the Continental Congress.
The list does not include any Acting Presidents under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
There have been 43 people sworn into office, and 44 presidencies, as Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 22nd and 24th president.
Of the individuals elected as president, four died in office of natural causes ( William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt ), four were assassinated ( Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy ) and one resigned ( Richard Nixon ).
George Washington, the first president, was inaugurated in 1789 after a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.
William Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office with 32 days in 1841, and Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest with over twelve years, but died shortly into his fourth term in 1945.
He is the only president to serve more than two terms, and a constitutional amendment, affecting presidents after Harry Truman, was passed to limit the number of times an individual can be elected president.
Andrew Jackson, the seventh president, was the first to be elected by men of all classes in 1828 after most laws barring non-land-owners from voting were repealed.
Warren Harding was the first elected after women gained voting rights in 1920.
History records four presidents – John Q Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Benjamin Harrison and George W. Bush – who lost the popular vote but assumed office.
John F. Kennedy has been the only president of Roman Catholic faith, and the current president, Barack Obama, is the first president of African descent.

This is a list of tables of the verified oldest people in the world in ordinal rank, such as oldest person or oldest man.
In these tables, a supercentenarian is considered 'verified ' if his or her claim has been validated by an international body that specifically deals in longevity research, such as the Gerontology Research Group ( GRG ) or Guinness World Records.
The longest unambiguously documented human lifespan is that of Jeanne Calment of France ( 1875–1997 ), who died at age 122 years, 164 days.
She met Vincent van Gogh when she was 12 or 13.
This led to news media attention in 1985, after Calment turned 110.
Subsequent investigation found documentation for Calment 's age, beyond any reasonable question, in the records of her native city, Arles, France.
More evidence of Calment 's lifespan has been produced than for any other supercentenarian ; her case serves as an archetype in the methodology for verifying the ages of the world 's oldest people.
The longest undisputed lifespan for male supercentenarians is that of Jiroemon Kimura, who currently lives in Japan and is age as of.
Since the death of 115-year old Dina Manfredini of the United States, on 17 December 2012, Kimura, born 19 April 1897, is the oldest living person in the world whose age can be documented.
He has also been the oldest living man since the death of 114-year old Walter Breuning on 14 April 2011.
Since the death of 115-year old Koto Okubo of Japan on 12 January 2013, the oldest living woman has been -year-old Misao Okawa, also from Japan, born on 5 March 1898.
The People 's Court is an American arbitration-based reality court show, currently presided over by retired Florida State Circuit Court Judge Marilyn Milian, in which small claims disputes are handled.
The People 's Court is the first court show to use binding arbitration, introducing the format into the genre in 1981.
The system has been duplicated by most of the show 's successors in the judicial genre.
Moreover, The People 's Court is the first popular, long-running reality in the judicial genre.
It was preceded only by a few short-lived realities in the genre ; these short-lived predecessors were only loosely related to judicial proceedings, except for one : Parole ( 1959 ) took footage from real-life courtrooms holding legal proceedings.
Prior to The People 's Court, the vast majority of TV courtroom shows used actors, and recreated or fictional cases ( as did radio before that ).
Among examples of these types of court shows include Famous Jury Trials and Your Witness.
The People 's Court has had two contrasting lives.
The show 's first life was presided over solely by former Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Joseph Wapner.
His tenure lasted from the show 's debut on September 14, 1981, until May 21, 1993, when the show was cancelled due to low ratings.
This left the show with a total of 2,484 1⁄2-hour episodes and 12 seasons.
The show was taped in Los Angeles during its first life.
After being cancelled, reruns aired until September 9, 1994.
On September 8, 1997, after being out of production for four years, The People 's Court was revived for a second life in first-run syndication as a 60-minute program.
Former lawyer and Mayor of New York Ed Koch was chosen as arbiter, which he maintained for 2 seasons from the 1997–98 season through the 1998–99 season ( the present life 's 2nd season and overall show 's 14th ).
By the 1999–00 season, husband of Judith Sheindlin ( who presides over Judge Judy ) and former New York State Supreme Court Judge Jerry Sheindlin succeeded Koch.
Sheindlin lasted one and a half seasons as he was replaced towards the end of the 2000–01 season ( present life 's 4th season and overall show 's 17th ).
Beginning in spring 2001, Florida judge Marilyn Milian took over The People 's Court and has presided over the show ever since.
Once Milian completes the 2012–13 season, she will have served as longest arbiter over the series with 12 and a half seasons.
As of the present, however, her years on the program tie Wapner at 12 seasons.
In the 2009-10 television season, The People 's Courts 2nd/present life outlasted its first when it reached 13 seasons.
While the show taped in New York City for the first 15 seasons of its second life, it now tapes in Stamford, Connecticut as of the 2012-13 season.
On September 3, 2012, The People 's Court 's 2nd/present life entered its 16th season ( 28th overall season ).
With 28 total seasons, The People 's Court ranks as the 2nd longest-running courtroom program behind the ongoing Divorce Court at 33 seasons ( from its 3 combined lives ).
Utah ( or ) ( Arapaho : Wo'tééneihí ' ) is a state in the Western United States.
It became the 45th state admitted to the Union on January 4, 1896.
Utah is the 13th-largest, the 34th-most populous, and the 10th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States.
Approximately 80 % of Utah 's 2,817,222 people live along the Wasatch Front, centering on Salt Lake City, leaving vast expanses of the state nearly uninhabited and making the population the sixth most urbanized in the U.S. Utah is bordered by Colorado on the east, Wyoming on the northeast, Idaho on the north, Arizona on the south, and Nevada on the west.
It also touches a corner of New Mexico on the southeast.
Utah is the most religiously homogeneous state in the Union.
Approximately 63 % of Utahns are reported to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS ( Mormons ), which greatly influences Utah culture and daily life.
The world headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) is located in Utah 's state capital.
The state is a center of transportation, education, information technology and research, government services, mining, and a major tourist destination for outdoor recreation.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau 's population estimates, Utah is the fifth fastest-growing state in the United States as of 2012.
St. George, was the fastest–growing metropolitan area in the United States from 2000 to 2005.
A 2012 Gallup national survey found Utah overall to be the `` best state to live in '' based on 13 forward-looking measurements including various economic, lifestyle, and health-related outlook metrics.
Coldwater is a small town in Tate County, Mississippi.
It is in the Memphis Metropolitan Area.
The population was 1,674 at the 2000 census.
The hard palate is a thin horizontal bony plate of the skull, located in the roof of the mouth.
It spans the arch formed by the upper teeth.
It is formed by the palatine process of the maxilla and horizontal plate of palatine bone.
It forms a partition between the nasal passages and the mouth.
Also on the anterior portion of the roof of the hard palate is the Rugae which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx.
This partition is continued deeper into the mouth by a fleshy extension called the soft palate.
Complete set of scrolls, constituting the entire Tanakh.
The Tanakh (, or ; also Tenakh, Tenak, Tanach ) is a name used in Judaism for the canon of the Hebrew Bible.
The Tanakh is also known as the Masoretic Text or the Miqra.
The name is an acronym formed from the initial Hebrew letters of the Masoretic Text 's three traditional subdivisions : The Torah ( `` Teaching '', also known as the Five Books of Moses ), Nevi'im ( `` Prophets '' ) and Ketuvim ( `` Writings '' ) —hence TaNaKh.
The name `` Miqra '' ( מקרא ), meaning `` that which is read '', is an alternative Hebrew term for the Tanakh.
The books of the Tanakh were relayed with an accompanying oral tradition passed on by each generation, called the Oral Torah.

Driving under the influence ( DUI ), driving while intoxicated ( DWI ), drunken driving, drunk driving, drink driving, operating under the influence, drinking and driving, or impaired driving is the crime of driving a motor vehicle with blood levels of alcohol in excess of a legal limit ( `` Blood Alcohol Content '', or `` BAC '' ).
Similar regulations cover driving or operating certain types of machinery while affected by drinking alcohol or taking other drugs, including, but not limited to prescription drugs.
This is a criminal offense in most nations.
Convictions do not necessarily involve actual driving of the vehicle.
In most jurisdictions a measurement such as a blood alcohol content ( BAC ) in excess of a specific threshold level, such as 0.05 % or 0.08 % defines the offense, with no need to prove impairment or being under the influence of alcohol.
In some jurisdictions, there is an aggravated category of the offense at a higher level e.g. 0.12 %.
In most countries, anyone who is convicted of injuring or killing someone while under the influence of alcohol or drugs can be heavily fined, as in France, in addition to being given a lengthy prison sentence.
Some jobs have their own rules and BAC limits, for example commercial pilot, and the Federal Railroad Administration in the United States has a 0.04 % limit for train crew.
Some jurisdictions have multiple levels of BAC ; for example, the state of California has a 0.08 % BAC limit, which is lowered to 0.04 % if the operator holds a commercial driver 's license.
The California BAC limit is 0.01 % for those younger than 21 years of age and those on probation for a previous DUI conviction.
Some large corporations have their own rules ; Union Pacific Railroad has their own BAC limit of 0.02 % that, if violated during a random test or a for-cause test — for example, after a traffic accident — can result in termination of employment with no chance of future re-hire.
Many states in the U.S. and provinces in Canada have adopted truth in sentencing laws that enforce strict guidelines on sentencing, differing from previous practice where prison time was reduced or suspended after sentencing had been issued.
Some jurisdictions have judicial guidelines requiring a mandatory minimum sentence.
Penalties for DUI charges range from expensive fees to forfetiruree of your license plates and in some serious circumstances, your vehicle.

The specific criminal offense may be called, depending on the jurisdiction, driving under the influence [ of alcohol or other drugs ] ( DUI ), driving under intense influence ( DUII ), driving while intoxicated ( DWI ), operating under the influence ( OUI ) operating while intoxicated ( OWI ), operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated ( OMVI ), driving under the combined influence of alcohol and/or other drugs, driving under the influence per se or drunk in charge [ of a vehicle ].
Many such laws apply also to motorcycling, boating, piloting aircraft, use of motile farm equipment such as tractors and combines, riding horses or driving a horse-drawn vehicle, or bicycling, possibly with different BAC level than driving.
In some jurisdictions there are separate charges depending on the vehicle used, such as BWI ( bicycling while intoxicated ), which may carry a lighter sentence.
In the United States, local law enforcement agencies made 1,467,300 arrests nationwide for driving under the influence of alcohol in 1996, compared to 1.9 million such arrests during the peak year in 1983.
In 1997 an estimated 513,200 DWI offenders were in prison or jail, down from 593,000 in 1990 and up from 270,100 in 1986.

Law enforcement in the United States is one of three major components of the criminal justice system of the United States, along with courts and corrections.
Although there exists an inherent interrelatedness between the different groups that make up the criminal justice system based on their crime deterrence purpose, each component operates independently from one another.
However, the judiciary is vested with the power to make legal determinations regarding the conduct of the other two components.
Apart from maintaining order and service functions, the purpose of policing is the investigation of suspected criminal activity and the referral of the results of investigations and of suspected criminals to the courts.
Law enforcement, to varying degrees at different levels of government and in different agencies, is also commonly charged with the responsibilities of deterring criminal activity and of preventing the successful commission of crimes in progress ; the service and enforcement of warrants, writs and other orders of the courts.
Law enforcement agencies are also involved in providing first response to emergencies and other threats to public safety ; the protection of certain public facilities and infrastructure ; the maintenance of public order ; the protection of public officials ; and the operation of some correctional facilities ( usually at the local level ).

`` World War Hulk '' is a comic book crossover storyline that ran through a self titled limited series and various other titles published by Marvel Comics in 2007, featuring the Hulk.
The series consists of five main issues titled World War Hulk, with Greg Pak as writer and John Romita, Jr. as penciller, and three other limited series : World War Hulk : Front Line, World War Hulk : Gamma Corps, and World War Hulk : X-Men.
It also ran through several other Marvel comics series.
The plot is the culmination of a series of events that began with the Hulk being tricked into space by the Illuminati and a life model decoy of Nick Fury, the Hulk 's subsequent exile seen in Planet Hulk and his imminent return to Earth to seek revenge on the Illuminati.
Marion Mitchell Morrison ( born Marion Robert Morrison ; May 26, 1907 – June 11, 1979 ), better known by his stage name John Wayne, was an American film actor, director and producer.
An Academy Award -winner, Wayne was among the top box office draws for three decades, and was named the all-time top money-making star.
An enduring American icon, he epitomized rugged masculinity and is famous for his demeanor, including his distinctive calm voice, walk, and height.
Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa but his family relocated to the greater Los Angeles area when he was four years old.
He found work at local film studios when he lost his football scholarship to USC as a result of a bodysurfing accident.
Initially working for the Fox Film Corporation, he mostly appeared in small bit parts.
His first leading role came in the widescreen epic The Big Trail ( 1930 ), which led to leading roles in numerous films throughout the 1930s, many of them in the western genre.
His career rose to further heights in 1939, with John Ford 's Stagecoach making him an instant superstar.
Wayne would go on to star in 142 pictures, primarily typecast in Western films.
Among his best known later films are The Quiet Man ( 1952 ), which follows him as an Irish-American boxer and his love affair with a fiery spinster played by Maureen O'Hara ; The Searchers ( 1956 ), in which he plays a Civil War veteran who seeks out his abducted niece ; Rio Bravo ( 1959 ), playing a Sheriff with Dean Martin ; True Grit ( 1969 ), playing a humorous U.S. Marshal who sets out to avenge a man 's death in the role that won Wayne an Academy Award ; and The Shootist ( 1976 ), his final screen performance in which he plays an aging gunslinger battling cancer.
Wayne moved to Orange County, California in the 1960s, and was a prominent Republican in Hollywood, supporting anti-communist positions.
He died of stomach cancer in 1979.
In June 1999, the American Film Institute named Wayne 13th among the Greatest Male Screen Legends of All Time.
Galileo Galilei ( ; 15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642 ), was an Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played a major role in the Scientific Revolution.
His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and support for Copernicanism.
Galileo has been called the `` father of modern observational astronomy ``, the `` father of modern physics ``, the `` father of science '', and `` the Father of Modern Science ''.
His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter ( named the Galilean moons in his honour ), and the observation and analysis of sunspots.
Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, inventing an improved military compass and other instruments.
Galileo 's championing of heliocentrism was controversial within his lifetime, when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system.
He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism due to the absence of an observed stellar parallax.
The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, and they concluded that it could be supported as only a possibility, not an established fact.
Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point.
He was tried by the Inquisition, found `` vehemently suspect of heresy '', forced to recant, and spent the rest of his life under house arrest.
It was while Galileo was under house arrest that he wrote one of his finest works, Two New Sciences, in which he summarised the work he had done some forty years earlier, on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.
55 '' LG OLED TV showcased at CES 2012
Prototype OLED lighting panel developed by Lumiotec
Demonstration of a flexible OLED device
An OLED ( organic light-emitting diode ) is a light-emitting diode ( LED ) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current.
This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes.
Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent.
OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld games consoles and PDAs.
A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications.
There are two main families of OLEDs : those based on small molecules and those employing polymers.
Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation.
OLED displays can use either passive-matrix ( PMOLED ) or active-matrix addressing schemes.
Active-matrix OLEDs ( AMOLED ) require a thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.
An OLED display works without a backlight.
Thus, it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display ( LCD ).
In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or LED backlight.
A carton and a glass of eggnog from Montreal, Canada, showing its French facade ( English reverse ) and the French term lait de poule ( literally, `` hen 's milk '' )
Eggnog, or egg nog, is a sweetened dairy -based beverage traditionally made with milk and/or cream, sugar, and whipped eggs ( which gives it a frothy texture ).
Brandy, rum, whisky, bourbon, vodka, or a combination of liquors are often added.
The finished serving is often garnished with a sprinkling of ground cinnamon or nutmeg.
It was also known as the egg milk punch.
Eggnog is a popular drink throughout the United States and Canada, and is usually associated with Christmas.
Eggnog may be added as a flavoring to food or drinks such as coffee and tea.
Eggnog as a custard can also be used as an ice cream base.
A pasty (, ), ( sometimes known in Britain as a Cornish pasty, and in the United States as a pastie or British pasty ) is a baked pastry, a traditional variety of which is particularly associated with Cornwall, the westernmost county in England.
It is made by placing uncooked filling typically of meat and vegetables, without meat in vegetarian versions, on a flat pastry circle and folding it to wrap the filling, crimping the edge to form a seal.
After baking, the result is a raised semicircular comestible.
The traditional Cornish pasty, which has Protected Geographical Indication ( PGI ) status in Europe, is filled with beef, sliced or diced potato, swede ( also known as a yellow turnip or rutabaga – referred to in Cornwall as turnip ) and onion, seasoned with salt and pepper, and is baked.
Today, the pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall, it is regarded as the national dish, and it accounts for 6 % of the Cornish food economy.
Pasties with many different fillings are made ; some shops specialise in selling all sorts of pasties.
The origins of the pasty are unclear, though there are many references to them throughout historical documents and fiction.
The pasty is now popular world-wide due to the spread of Cornish miners, and variations can be found in Australia, the United States, Mexico and elsewhere.
The ( ortho- ) sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) is one of three major parts of the autonomic nervous system : the others being the enteric and parasympathetic systems.
Its general action is to mobilize the body 's nervous system fight-or-flight response.
It is, however, constantly active at a basic level to maintain homeostasis.
Secure Digital or ( SD ) is a non-volatile memory card format for use in portable devices, such as mobile phones, digital cameras, GPS navigation devices, and tablet computers.
The Secure Digital standard is maintained by the SD Card Association ( SDA ).
SD technologies have been implemented in more than 400 brands across dozens of product categories and more than 8,000 models.
The Secure Digital format includes four card families available in three different form factors.
The four families are the original Standard-Capacity ( SDSC ), the High-Capacity ( SDHC ), the eXtended-Capacity ( SDXC ), and the SDIO, which combines input/output functions with data storage.
The three form factors are the original size, the `` mini '' size, and the `` micro '' size ( see illustration ).
There are many combinations of form factors and device families.
Electrically passive adapters allow the use of a smaller card in a host device built to hold a larger card.
Host devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide backward compatibility and accept older SD cards, but this article explains several factors that can prevent the use of a newer SD card:
A newer card may offer greater capacity than the host device can handle.
A newer card may use a file system the host device can not navigate.
Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides.
The organization of the card was changed starting with the SDHC family.
Some vendors produced SDSC cards above 1 GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so.
The SDA uses several trademarked logos to enforce compliance with its specifications and assure users of compatibility.

Daniel Lawrence Whitney ( born February 17, 1963 ) best known by his stage name and character Larry the Cable Guy, is an American stand-up comedian, actor, country music artist, voice actor, and former radio personality.
He was one of the members of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, a comedy troupe which included Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Jeff Foxworthy ( with whom he has starred on Blue Collar TV ).
Whitney has released seven comedy albums, of which three have been certified gold by the RIAA for shipments of 500,000 copies.
In addition, he has starred in three Blue Collar Comedy Tour-related movies, as well as in the films Larry the Cable Guy : Health Inspector, Delta Farce, and Witless Protection, as well as voicing Mater in the Cars franchise.
Whitney 's catchphrase : `` Git-R-Done ! '' is also the title of his book.
On January 26, 2010, the TV channel History announced that it was ordering a series starring Whitney called Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy, in which he would explore the country and immerse himself in different lifestyles, jobs, and hobbies.
The first episode of the series aired on February 8, 2011.
Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible for intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate.
In humans, the most important related compounds of vitamin D are vitamin D2 and vitamin D3.
Cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) and ergocalciferol ( vitamin D2 ) are unique as they constitute what we know as vitamin D and can be ingested from the diet and/or supplements.
The body can also synthesize vitamin D ( from cholesterol ) when sun exposure is adequate ( hence its nickname, the `` sunshine vitamin '' ).
Although vitamin D is commonly called a vitamin, it is not actually an essential dietary vitamin in the strict sense, as it can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sunlight.
( Cats and dogs can not synthesize vitamin D efficiently and must receive it in their diet. )
An organic chemical compound ( or related set of compounds ) is only scientifically called a vitamin when it can not be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must be obtained from their diet.
However, as with other compounds commonly called vitamins, vitamin D was discovered in an effort to find the dietary substance that was lacking in a disease, namely, rickets, the childhood form of osteomalacia.
Additionally, like other compounds called vitamins, in the developed world vitamin D is added to staple foods, such as milk, to avoid disease due to deficiency.
Measures of serum levels reflect endogenous synthesis from exposure to sunlight as well as intake from the diet, and it is believed that synthesis may contribute generally to the maintenance of adequate serum concentrations.
The evidence indicates that the synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure works in a feedback loop that prevents toxicity but, because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight, no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine, USA, for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D requirements.
Accordingly, the Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D assume that no synthesis occurs and that all of a person 's vitamin D is from their diet, although that will rarely occur in practice.
In the liver vitamin D is converted to calcidiol, which is also known as calcifediol ( INN ), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D—abbreviated 25 ( OH ) D ; and which is the specific vitamin D metabolite that is measured in serum to determine a person 's vitamin D status.
Part of the calcidiol is converted by the kidneys to calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood, regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone.
Calcidiol is also converted to calcitriol outside of the kidneys for other purposes, such as the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of cells ; calcitriol also affects neuromuscular function and inflammation.
Beyond its use to prevent osteomalacia or rickets, the evidence for other health effects of vitamin D supplementation in the general population is inconsistent.
The best evidence of benefit is for bone health and a decrease in mortality in elderly women.
Standard form of the periodic table.
The colors represent different categories of elements explained below.
The periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic numbers, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties.
Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number ( number of protons ).
The standard form of table comprises an 18 × 7 grid or main body of elements, positioned above a smaller double row of elements.
The table can also be deconstructed into four rectangular blocks : the s-block to the left, the p-block to the right, the d-block in the middle, and the f-block below that.
The rows of the table are called periods ; the columns of the s-, d-, and p-blocks are called groups, with some of these having names such as the halogens or the noble gases.
Since, by definition, a periodic table incorporates recurring trends, any such table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements and predict the properties of new, yet to be discovered or synthesized, elements.
As a result, a periodic table—whether in the standard form or some other variant—provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior, and such tables are widely used in chemistry and other sciences.
Although precursors exist, Dmitri Mendeleev is generally credited with the publication, in 1869, of the first widely recognized periodic table.
He developed his table to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then-known elements.
Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table.
Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered.
Mendeleev 's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behavior.
All elements from atomic numbers 1 ( hydrogen ) to 118 ( ununoctium ) have been discovered or synthesized.
The elements from 1 to 98 ( californium ) have been found to exist naturally, although some are found only in trace amounts and were initially discovered by synthesis in laboratories.
The elements after 98 have only been synthesized in laboratories.
Production of elements beyond ununoctium is being pursued, with the question of how the periodic table may need to be modified to accommodate any such additions being a matter of ongoing debate.
Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories.
Minimum wage by U.S. state and U.S. territory ( American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands ), as of Jan. 1, 2013.
In the United States, workers are generally entitled to be paid no less than the statutory minimum wage.
The federal government mandates a nationwide minimum wage level of $ 7.25 per hour, while some states and municipalities have set minimum wage levels higher than the federal level, with the highest state minimum wage being $ 9.19 per hour in Washington as of 2013.
Among those paid by the hour in 2012, 1.6 million were reported as earning exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage.
About 2.0 million were reported as earning wages below the minimum.
Together, these 3.6 million workers with wages at or below the minimum made up 4.7 percent of all hourly-paid workers.
A selection of Bourbons and Tennessee whiskeys offered at a liquor store in Decatur, Georgia
Evan Williams bourbon whiskey
Bourbon whiskey is a type of American whiskey – a barrel-aged distilled spirit made primarily from corn.
The name of the spirit derives from its historical association with an area known as Old Bourbon, around what is now Bourbon County, Kentucky ( which, in turn, was named after the French House of Bourbon royal family ).
It has been produced since the 18th century.
While it may be made anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with the American South in general, and Kentucky in particular.
The Mona Lisa ( La Gioconda or La Joconde ) is a half-length portrait of a woman by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, which has been acclaimed as `` the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world. ''
The painting, thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, is in oil on a poplar panel, and is believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506.
It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre in Paris since 1797.
The ambiguity of the subject 's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modeling of forms and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work.
Robert Allen Palmer ( 19 January 1949 – 26 September 2003 ), was an English singer-songwriter and musician.
He was known for his distinctive voice and the eclectic mix of musical styles on his albums, combining soul, jazz, rock, pop, reggae and blues.
He found success both in his solo career and in the musical act The Power Station, and had Top 10 songs in both the UK and the US.
His iconic music videos by Terence Donovan for the hits `` Addicted to Love `` and `` Simply Irresistible `` featured identically dressed dancing women with pale faces, dark eye makeup and bright red lipstick, which resembled the women in the art of Patrick Nagel, an artist popular in the 1980s.
Sharp-suited, his involvement in the music industry commenced in the 1960s, covered five decades and included a spell with Vinegar Joe.
Palmer received a number of awards throughout his career, including two Grammy Awards for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, an MTV Video Music Award, and was twice nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male.
Computed tomography angiography ( CTA ) is a computed tomography technique used to visualize arterial and venous vessels throughout the body.
This ranges from arteries serving the brain to those bringing blood to the lungs, kidneys, arms and legs.

Prise de la Bastille by Jean-Pierre-Louis-Laurent Houel
Bastille Day is the name given in English-speaking countries to the French National Day, which is celebrated on the 14th of July each year.
In France, it is formally called La Fête Nationale ( ; The National Celebration ) and commonly Le quatorze juillet ( ; the fourteenth of July ).
It commemorates the 1790 Fête de la Fédération, held on the first anniversary of the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 ; the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille fortress-prison was seen as a symbol of the uprising of the modern nation, and of the reconciliation of all the French inside the constitutional monarchy which preceded the First Republic, during the French Revolution.
Festivities and official ceremonies are held all over France.
The oldest and largest regular military parade in Europe is held on the morning of 14 July, on the Champs-Élysées avenue in Paris in front of the President of the Republic, French officials and foreign guests.
The United States of America ( USA or U.S.A. ), commonly called the United States ( US or U.S. ) or America, is a federal republic consisting of fifty states and a federal district.
The lower forty-eight contiguous states and the federal district of Washington, D.C. are in central North America between Canada and Mexico.
The state of Alaska is west of Canada and east of Russia across the Bering Strait, and the state of Hawaii is in the mid-North Pacific.
The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean.
At 3.79 million square miles ( 9.83 million km2 ) and with around 315 million people, the United States is the third- or fourth-largest country by total area and the third-largest by both land area and population.
It is one of the world 's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries.
The geography and climate of the U.S. is also extremely diverse, with deserts, plains, forests, and mountains that are home to a wide variety of species.
Paleoindians migrated from Asia to what is now the United States mainland around 15,000 years ago.
After 1500, Old World diseases introduced by Europeans greatly reduced their populations.
European colonization began around 1600 and came mostly from England.
The United States emerged from thirteen British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard.
Disputes between Great Britain and the American colonies led to the American Revolution.
On July 4, 1776, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence, which established the United States of America.
The American Revolutionary War, which ended with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire.
The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787 ; twenty-seven Amendments have since been added to the Constitution.
The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.
Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century.
This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states.
The American Civil War ended legalized slavery in the United States.
By the end of the nineteenth century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world 's largest.
The Spanish–American War and confirmed the country 's status as a global military power.
The United States emerged from as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.
The United States is a developed country and has the world 's largest national economy, with an estimated 2012 GDP of $ 15.6 trillion 19 % of global GDP at purchasing-power parity, as of 2011.
The per capita GDP of the U.S. was the world 's sixth-highest as of 2010, although America 's wealth inequality was also ranked highest among OECD countries by the World Bank.
The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity ; and while its economy is considered post-industrial it continues to be one of the world 's largest manufacturers.
The country accounts for 39 % of global military spending, and is a leading economic, political, and cultural force in the world, as well as a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.
The NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship is a single-elimination tournament played each spring in the United States, currently featuring 68 college basketball teams, to determine the national championship of the major college basketball teams.
The tournament, organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ), was created during 1939 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches, and was the idea of Ohio State University coach Harold Olsen.
Played mostly during March, it is known informally as March Madness or the Big Dance, and has become one of the most famous annual sporting events in the United States.
The NCAA has credited Bob Walsh of the Seattle Organizing Committee for starting the March Madness celebration during 1984.
The tournament teams include champions from 31 Division I conferences ( which receive automatic bids ), and 37 teams which are awarded at-large berths.
These `` at-large '' teams are chosen by an NCAA selection committee, as detailed below.
The 64 teams are divided into four regions and organized into a single elimination `` bracket '', which predetermines, when a team wins a game, which team it will face next.
Each team is `` seeded '', or ranked, within its region.
After an initial four games between eight lower-ranked teams, the tournament occurs during the course of three weekends, at pre-selected neutral sites around the United States.
Lower-ranked teams are placed in the bracket against higher ranked teams.
Each weekend eliminates three-fourths of the teams, from a round of 64, to a `` Sweet Sixteen '', and for the last weekend of the Tournament a Final Four ; the Final Four is usually played during the first weekend of April.
These four teams, one from each region, then compete in one location for the national championship.
The tournament has been at least partially televised since 1969.
Presently, the games are reported by CBS, TBS, TNT, and truTV by the trade-name NCAA March Madness.
Since 2011, all games are available for viewing nationwide.
As television coverage has grown, so too has the tournament 's popularity.
Presently, millions of Americans `` fill out a bracket '', predicting winners of all 67 games.
With 11 national titles, UCLA has the record for the most NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championships ; John Wooden coached UCLA to 10 of its 11 titles.
The University of Kentucky is second, with 8 national titles, while Indiana University and the University of North Carolina are tied for third with 5 national titles.
Duke University ranks fifth with 4 national titles.
A sample of synthetic motor oil
Synthetic oil is a lubricant consisting of chemical compounds that are artificially made ( synthesized ).
Synthetic lubricants can be manufactured using chemically modified petroleum components rather than whole crude oil, but can also be synthesized from other raw materials.
Synthetic oil is used as a substitute for lubricant refined from petroleum when operating in extremes of temperature, because, in general, it provides superior mechanical and chemical properties than those found in traditional mineral oils.
Aircraft jet engines, for example, require the use of synthetic oils, whereas aircraft piston engines do not.
Jackass is an American reality series, originally shown on MTV from 2000 to 2002, featuring people performing various dangerous, crude self-injuring stunts and pranks.
The show served as a launchpad for the television and acting careers of Bam Margera, Steve-O, and also Johnny Knoxville, who previously had only a few minor acting roles.
Since 2002, three Jackass films have been produced and released by MTV corporate sibling Paramount Pictures, continuing the franchise after its run on television.
The show sparked several spin-offs including Viva La Bam, Wildboyz, Homewrecker, Dr. Steve-O and Blastazoid.
The show placed # 68 on Entertainment Weekly `` New TV Classics '' list.
Roseanne Cherrie Barr ( born November 3, 1952 ) is an American actress, comedienne, writer, television producer, director, and 2012 presidential nominee of the California -based Peace and Freedom Party.
Barr began her career in stand-up comedy at clubs before gaining fame for her role in the sitcom Roseanne.
The show was a hit and lasted nine seasons, from 1988 to 1997.
She won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her work on the show.
Barr had crafted a `` fierce working-class domestic goddess '' persona in the eight years preceding her sitcom and wanted to do a realistic show about a strong mother who was not a victim of patriarchal consumerism.
The granddaughter of immigrants from Europe and Russia, Barr was the oldest of four children in a working-class Jewish Salt Lake City family ; she was also active in the LDS Church.
In 1974, she married Bill Pentland, with whom she had three children, before divorcing in 1990 and marrying comedian Tom Arnold for four years.
Controversy arose when she sang `` The Star-Spangled Banner `` off-key at a 1990 nationally aired baseball game, followed by grabbing her crotch and spitting.
After her sitcom ended, she launched her own talk show, The Roseanne Show, which aired from 1998 to 2000.
In 2005, she returned to stand-up comedy with a world tour.
In 2011, she starred in an unscripted TV show, Roseanne 's Nuts, that lasted from July to September of that year, about her life on a Hawaiian farm.
In early 2012, Barr announced her candidacy for the Presidential nomination of the Green Party.
Barr lost the nomination to Jill Stein.
She then sought the presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party, which she won on August 4, 2012.
Barr received 61,971 votes in the general election, placing sixth overall.
Francesco Albani 's 17th century Baptism of Christ is a typical depiction with the sky opening and the Holy Spirit descending as a dove.
The baptism of Jesus marks the beginning of his public ministry.
This event is recorded in the canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke.
John 's gospel does not describe Jesus ' baptism, but John the Baptist does testify of the other things in.
In the New Testament, John the Baptist preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ( ), and declared himself a forerunner of he that would baptize `` with the Holy Ghost and with fire '' ( ).
In so doing he was preparing the way for Jesus.
Jesus came to the Jordan River where he was baptized by John.
The baptismal scene includes the heavens opening, a dove-like descent of the Holy Spirit, and a voice from heaven saying, `` This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. ''
Most modern scholars view the fact that Jesus was baptized by John as an historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned.
Along with the crucifixion of Jesus most scholars view it as one of the two historically certain facts about him, and often use it as the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus.
The baptism is one of the five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus, the others being the Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension.
Most Christian denominations view the baptism of Jesus as an important event and a basis for the Christian rite of baptism ( see also ).
In Eastern Christianity, Jesus ' baptism is commemorated on 6 January, the feast of Epiphany.
In the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Lutheran Churches and some other Western denominations, it is recalled on a day within the following week, the feast of the baptism of the Lord.
In Roman Catholicism, the baptism of Jesus is one of the Luminous Mysteries sometimes added to the Rosary.
It is a Trinitarian feast in the Eastern Orthodox Churches.
Methylcobalamin ( shown ) is a form of vitamin B12.
Physically it resembles the other forms of vitamin B12, occurring as dark red crystals that freely form cherry-colored transparent solutions in water.
Vitamin B12, vitamin B12 or vitamin B-12, also called cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system, and for the formation of blood.
It is one of the eight B vitamins.
It is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body, especially affecting DNA synthesis and regulation, but also fatty acid synthesis and energy production.
Neither fungi, plants, nor animals are capable of producing vitamin B12.
Only bacteria and archaea have the enzymes required for its synthesis, although many foods are a natural source of B12 because of bacterial symbiosis.
The vitamin is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin and can be produced industrially only through bacterial fermentation-synthesis.
Vitamin B12 consists of a class of chemically related compounds ( vitamers ), all of which have vitamin activity.
It contains the biochemically rare element cobalt.
Biosynthesis of the basic structure of the vitamin is accomplished only by bacteria ( which usually produce hydroxocobalamin ), but conversion between different forms of the vitamin can be accomplished in the human body.
A common semi-synthetic form of the vitamin, cyanocobalamin, does not occur in nature, but is produced from bacterial hydroxocobalamin and then used in many pharmaceuticals and supplements, and as a food additive, because of its stability and lower production cost.
In the body it is converted to the human physiological forms methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, leaving behind the cyanide, albeit in minimal concentration.
More recently, hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin can be found in more expensive pharmacological products and food supplements.
The extra utility of these is currently debated.
Vitamin B12 was discovered from its relationship to the disease pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disease in which parietal cells of the stomach responsible for secreting intrinsic factor are destroyed.
Intrinsic factor is crucial for the normal absorption of B12, so a lack of intrinsic factor, as seen in pernicious anemia, causes a vitamin B12 deficiency.
Many other subtler kinds of vitamin B12 deficiency and their biochemical effects have since been elucidated.
Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 war film produced, directed and co-written by Stanley Kubrick.
It is an adaptation of Gustav Hasford 's 1979 novel The Short-Timers and stars Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, R. Lee Ermey, Arliss Howard, and Adam Baldwin.
The film follows a platoon of U.S. Marines through their training and the experiences of two of the platoon 's Marines in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War.
The film 's title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by infantry riflemen.
The film received critical acclaim.
It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for Kubrick, Michael Herr and Gustav Hasford.
In 2001, the American Film Institute placed Full Metal Jacket at # 95 in their `` AFI 's 100 Years... 100 Thrills `` poll.
TMZ is a celebrity news website that debuted on November 8, 2005.
It was a collaboration between AOL and Telepictures Productions, a division of Warner Bros., until Time Warner divested AOL in 2009.
However, it remained affiliated with AOL News and has the AOL News logo affixed in the upper right corner.
The name TMZ stands for the historic `` studio zone `` or 30-mile zone radius from the intersection of West Beverly Boulevard and North La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles.
TMZ 's managing editor is Harvey Levin, a lawyer-turned-journalist who was previously a legal expert for the Los Angeles television station KCBS-TV.
The site claims that it does not pay for stories or interviews ; however, Levin has admitted that TMZ does `` sometimes pay sources for leads on stories ''.
Levin has stated that `` everything is researched and vetted for accuracy. ''
A companion TV series, TMZ on TV, debuted on September 10, 2007.
Scream 3 is a 2000 American slasher film created by Kevin Williamson, directed by Wes Craven and written by Ehren Kruger, starring Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette.
It was released on February 4, 2000 as the third installment in the Scream film series.
The events of the story are set three years after those of Scream 2 and follows Sidney Prescott ( Campbell ) who has gone into self-imposed isolation following the events of the previous two films but is drawn to Hollywood after a new Ghostface begins killing the cast of the film within a film `` Stab 3 ''.
Scream 3 combines the violence of the slasher genre with comedy and `` whodunit `` mystery while satirizing the cliché of film trilogies.
Unlike the previous Scream films, there was an increased emphasis on comedic elements and the violence and horror was reduced in response to increased public scrutiny about violence in media following the Columbine High School massacre.
The film was the concluding chapter of the Scream series until it was revived with a sequel, Scream 4, in 2011.
Williamson provided a five-page outline for two sequels to Scream when auctioning his original script, hoping to entice bidders with the potential of buying a franchise.
Williamson 's commitments to other projects meant he was unable to develop a complete script for Scream 3 and writing duties were undertaken by Ehren Kruger who discarded much of Williamson 's notes.
Craven and Marco Beltrami returned to direct and score the film respectively as they had with the previous two series entries.
Production was troubled with script rewrites, with pages sometimes only ready on the day of filming, and scheduling difficulties with the main cast.
Scream 3 performed both financially and critically worse than its preceding films, earning over $ 161 million and with many critics claiming that the film had become what Scream originally `` spoofed ``.
Despite negative criticism the film did receive praise with reviewers calling it the perfect end to the Scream trilogy.
As of 2012, the film is currently the number 3 highest-grossing slasher-film in North America, following Scream at number 1 and Scream 2 at number 2.
The film 's soundtrack was well-received, spending fourteen weeks on the Billboard 200 and reaching a high of # 32.
Shoulder impingement syndrome, also called painful arc syndrome, supraspinatus syndrome, swimmer 's shoulder, and thrower 's shoulder, is a clinical syndrome which occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles become irritated and inflamed as they pass through the subacromial space, the passage beneath the acromion.
This can result in pain, weakness and loss of movement at the shoulder.
JLA was a monthly comic book published by DC Comics from January 1997 to April 2006 featuring the Justice League.
The colonial history of the United States covers the history of European settlements from the start of colonization of America until their incorporation into the United States.
In the late 16th century, England, France, Spain and the Netherlands launched major colonization programs in eastern North America.
Small early attempts—such as the English Lost Colony of Roanoke —often disappeared ; everywhere the death rate of the first arrivals was very high.
Nevertheless successful colonies were established.
European settlers came from a variety of social and religious groups.
No aristocrats settled permanently, but a number of adventurers, soldiers, farmers, and tradesmen arrived.
Diversity was an American characteristic as the Dutch of New Netherland, the Swedes and Finns of New Sweden, the English Quakers of Pennsylvania, the English Puritans of New England, the English settlers of Jamestown, and the `` worthy poor '' of Georgia, came to the new continent and built colonies with distinctive social, religious, political and economic styles.
Occasionally one colony took control of another ( during wars between their European parents ).
Only in Nova Scotia ( now part of Canada ) did the conquerors expel the previous colonists.
Instead they all lived side by side in peace.
There were no major civil wars among the 13 colonies, and the two chief armed rebellions ( in Virginia in 1676 and in New York in 1689–91 ) were short-lived failures.
Wars between the French and the British—the French and Indian Wars and Father Rale 's War —were recurrent, and involved French-support for Wabanaki Confederacy attacks on the frontiers.
By 1760 France was defeated and the British seized its colonies.
The four distinct regions were : New England, the Middle Colonies, the Chesapeake Bay Colonies ( Upper South ) and the Lower South.
Some historians add a fifth region, the Frontier, which was never separately organized.
By the time European settlers arrived around 1600–1650, the majority of the Native Americans living in the eastern United States had been decimated by new diseases, introduced to them decades before by explorers and sailors.
See timeline of Colonial America for list of historical events.
Gloria Laura Vanderbilt ( born February 20, 1924 ) is an American artist, author, actress, heiress, and socialite most noted as an early developer of designer blue jeans.
She is a member of the prominent Vanderbilt family of New York and the mother of CNN 's Anderson Cooper.
Greece ( Romanization of Greek| ), officially the Hellenic Republic ( ' ), is a country in Southeast Europe.
According to the 2011 census, Greece 's population is around 11 million.
Athens is the nation 's capital and largest city, its urban area also including Piraeus.
Greece is strategically located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, and has land borders with Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the northeast.
The Aegean Sea lies to the east of mainland Greece, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Greece has the 11th longest coastline in the world at in length, featuring a vast number of islands ( approximately 1,400, of which 227 are inhabited ), including Crete, the Dodecanese, the Cyclades, and the Ionian Islands among others.
Eighty percent of Greece consists of mountains, of which Mount Olympus is the highest at.
Modern Greece traces its roots to the civilization of Ancient Greece, generally considered the cradle of Western civilization.
As such, it is the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, the Olympic Games, Western literature and historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, and Western drama, including both tragedy and comedy.
This legacy is partly reflected in the seventeen UNESCO World Heritage Sites located in Greece, ranking it 7th in Europe and 13th in the world.
The modern Greek state was established in 1830, following the Greek War of Independence.
Greece is a founding member of the United Nations, has been a member of what is now the European Union since 1981 ( and the eurozone since 2001 ), and has been a member of NATO since 1952.
Greece is a developed country with an advanced, high-income economy and very high standards of living, including the world 's 21st highest quality of life as of 2010.
Greece 's economy is also the largest in the Balkans, where Greece is an important regional investor.
A prime meridian is a meridian, i.e. a line of longitude, at which longitude is defined to be 0°.
A prime meridian and its opposite in a 360°-system, the 180th meridian ( at 180° longitude ), form a great circle.
This great circle divides the sphere, e.g. the Earth, into two hemispheres.
If one uses directions of East and West from a defined prime meridian, then they can be called Eastern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.
Gerardus Mercator in his Atlas Cosmographicae ( 1595 ) uses a prime meridian somewhere close to 25°W, passing just to the west of Santa Maria Island in the Atlantic.
His 180th meridian runs along the Strait of Anián ( Bering Strait )
A prime meridian is ultimately arbitrary, unlike an equator, which is determined by the axis of rotation—and various conventions have been used or advocated in different regions and throughout history.
Minka Dumont Kelly ( born Minka Dumont Dufay ; June 24, 1980 ) is an American actress.
She is perhaps best known for her roles in Charlie 's Angels, Friday Night Lights, and The Roommate.
R.O.B. ( Robotic Operating Buddy ), released in Japan as the, is an accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ).
It was released in July 1985 in Japan and later that year in North America.
It had a short product lifespan, with support for only two games which comprised the `` Robot Series '' ; Gyromite and Stack-Up.
R.O.B. was released with the intention of portraying the Nintendo Entertainment System as something novel in order to alleviate retail fears following the video game crash of 1983.
R.O.B. was available in the Deluxe Set, a configuration for the console that included, among other things, R.O.B. and Gyromite.
Stack-Up was purchased separately and included its own physical game pieces.
The Walking Liberty half dollar was a silver 50-cent piece or half dollar coin issued by the United States Mint from 1916 to 1947 ; it was designed by Adolph A. Weinman.
In 1915, the new Mint Director, Robert W. Woolley, came to believe that he was not only allowed but required by law to replace coin designs that had been in use for 25 years.
He therefore began the process of replacing the Barber coinage : dimes, quarters and half dollars, all bearing similar designs by long-time Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber, and first struck in 1892.
Woolley had the Commission of Fine Arts conduct a competition, as a result of which Weinman was selected to design the dime and half dollar.
Weinman 's design of Liberty striding towards the Sun for the half dollar proved difficult to perfect, and Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo, whose department included the Mint, considered having Barber create his own design.
Mint officials were successful in getting Weinman 's design into production, although it never struck very well, which may have been a factor in its replacement by the Franklin half dollar beginning in 1948.
Nevertheless, art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered the piece to be among the most beautiful US coins.
Since 1986, a modification of Weinman 's obverse design has been used for the American Silver Eagle.
The Toyota 4Runner is a mid-size sport utility vehicle ( SUV ) produced by the Japanese manufacturer Toyota and sold throughout the world from 1984 to present.
In Japan it was known as the Toyota Hilux Surf.
The original 4Runner was a compact SUV and little more than a Toyota pickup truck with a fiberglass shell over the bed, but the model has since undergone significant independent development into a cross between a compact and a mid-size SUV.
All 4Runners have been built at Toyota 's Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, Japan, or at Hino Motors ' Hamura, Japan plant, and in Brazil.
Its mid-size crossover SUV counterpart is the Toyota Highlander.
This article deals with medicine as practiced by trained professionals from ancient times to the present.
The ancient Egyptians had a system of medicine that was very advanced for its time and influenced later medical traditions.
The Egyptians and Babylonians both introduced the concepts of diagnosis, prognosis, and medical examination.
The Greeks went even further, and advanced as well medical ethics.
The Hippocratic Oath, still taken by doctors today, was written in Greece in the 5th century BCE.
In the medieval era, surgical practices inherited from the ancient masters were improved and then systematized in Rogerius 's The Practice of Surgery.
Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy.
During the Renaissance, understanding of anatomy improved, and the microscope was invented.
The germ theory of disease in the 19th century led to cures for many infectious diseases.
Military doctors advanced the methods of trauma treatment and surgery.
Public health measures were developed especially in the 19th century as the rapid growth of cities required systematic sanitary measures.
Advanced research centers opened in the early 20th century, often connected with major hospitals.
The mid-20th century was characterized by new biological treatments, such as antibiotics.
These advancements, along with developments in chemistry, genetics, and lab technology ( such as the x-ray ) led to modern medicine.
Medicine was heavily professionalized in the 20th century, and new careers opened to women as nurses ( from the 1870s ) and as physicians ( especially after 1970 ).
The 21st century is characterized by very advanced research involving numerous fields of science.
The Hippocratic Corpus, is a collection of early medical works from ancient Greece strongly associated with the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates and his teachings.
Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K ( from Neo-Latin kalium ) and atomic number 19.
Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and is very reactive with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite the hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac flame.
Because potassium and sodium are chemically very similar, their salts were not at first differentiated.
The existence of multiple elements in their salts was suspected from 1702, and this was proven in 1807 when potassium and sodium were individually isolated from different salts by electrolysis.
Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts.
As such, it is found dissolved in seawater ( which is 0.04 % potassium by weight ), and is part of many minerals.
Most industrial chemical applications of potassium employ the relatively high solubility in water of potassium compounds, such as potassium soaps.
Potassium metal has only a few special applications, being replaced in most chemical reactions with sodium metal.
Potassium ions are necessary for the function of all living cells.
Potassium ion diffusion is a key mechanism in nerve transmission, and potassium depletion in animals, including humans, results in various cardiac dysfunctions.
Potassium accumulates in plant cells, and thus fresh fruits and vegetables are a good dietary source of it.
Conversely, most plants except specialist halophytes are intolerant of salt, and sodium is present in them only in low concentration.
This resulted in potassium first being isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, giving the element its name.
For the same reason, heavy crop production rapidly depletes soils of potassium, and agricultural fertilizers consume 95 % of global potassium chemical production.
The Singapore dollar or dollar ( sign : $ ; code : SGD ) is the official currency of Singapore.
It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively S $ to distinguish it from other dollar -denominated currencies.
It is divided into 100 cents.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Brunei Currency and Monetary Board still maintain the historic exchangeability of their two currencies, the Singaporean dollar and the Brunei dollar, respectively.
The dollar is accepted as `` customary tender '' in Brunei according to the Currency Interchangeability Agreement.
Likewise, the Brunei dollar is customarily accepted in Singapore
James Samuel Coleman ( May 12, 1926 – March 25, 1995 ) was an American sociologist, theorist and empirical researcher, based chiefly at the University of Chicago.
He was elected president of the American Sociological Association.
Coleman studied the sociology of education, public policy, and was one of the earliest users of the term `` social capital ``.
His Foundations of Social Theory influenced sociological theory.
His The Adolescent Society ( 1961 ) and `` Coleman Report '' ( Equality of Educational Opportunity, 1966 ) were two of the most heavily cited books in educational sociology.
The landmark Coleman Report helped transform educational theory, reshape national education policies, and influenced public and scholarly opinion regarding the role of schooling in determining equality and productivity in the United States.
Superman ( from DC comics ) was the first superhero created, art by Jim Lee.
A superhero ( sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero ) is a type of stock character possessing `` extraordinary or superhuman powers '' and dedicated to protecting the public.
Since the debut of the prototypical superhero Superman in 1938, stories of superheroes—ranging from brief episodic adventures to continuing years-long sagas—have dominated American comic books and crossed over into other media.
The word itself dates to at least 1917.
A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine ( also rendered super-heroine or super heroine ).
`` SUPER HEROES '' is a trademark co-owned by DC Comics and Marvel Comics.
By most definitions, characters do not strictly require actual superhuman powers to be deemed superheroes, although terms such as costumed crime fighters or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to those such as Batman and Green Arrow without such powers who share other common superhero traits.
Such characters were generally referred to as `` mystery men '' in the so-called Golden Age of Comic Books to distinguish them from characters with super-powers.
Normally, superheroes use their powers to counter day-to-day crime while also combating threats against humanity by supervillains, their criminal counterparts.
Often, one of these supervillains will be the superhero 's archenemy.
As well, some longrunning superheroes, such as Superman, Batman, Spider-Man and Iron Man each has a rogues gallery of enemies.
As well, superheroes sometimes will combat such irregular threats as aliens, magical/ fantasy entities, American war enemies such as nazism or communism, and godlike or demonic creatures.
The following is a historical list of actors and primary character roles which appear on the American soap opera One Life to Live.
The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.
Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence.
During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd `` Red '' Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.
Despite a lukewarm box office reception that barely recouped its budget, the film received favorable reviews from critics, multiple award nominations, and has since enjoyed a remarkable life on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.
It was included in the American Film Institute 's 100 Years... 100 Movies 10th Anniversary Edition.
IT management is the discipline whereby all of the technology resources of a firm are managed in accordance with its needs and priorities.
These resources may include tangible investments like computer hardware, software, data, networks and data centre facilities, as well as the staffs who are hired to maintain them.
Managing this responsibility within a company entails many of the basic management functions, like budgeting, staffing, and organizing and controlling, along with other aspects that are unique to technology, like change management, software design, network planning, tech support etc.
The Penitentiary of New Mexico Prison Riot, which took place on February 2 and 3, 1980, in the state 's maximum security prison south of Santa Fe, was one of the most violent prison riots in the history of the American correctional system : 33 inmates died and more than 200 inmates were treated for injuries.
None of the 12 officers taken hostage were killed, but seven were treated for injuries caused by beatings and rapes.
This was the third major riot at the NM State Penitentiary, the first occurring on 19 July 1922 and the second on 15 June 1953.
Author Roger Morris suggests the death toll may have been higher, as a number of bodies were incinerated or dismembered during the course of the mayhem.
`` Red Cardinal '' redirects here.
For the plant Erythrina herbacea, see Coral Bean.
The Northern Cardinal ( Cardinalis cardinalis ) is a North American bird in the genus Cardinalis ; it is also known colloquially as the redbird or common cardinal.
It can be found in southern Canada, through the eastern United States from Maine to Texas and south through Mexico.
It is found in woodlands, gardens, shrublands, and swamps.
The Northern Cardinal is a mid-sized songbird with a body length of 21 centimeters ( 8.3 inches ).
It has a distinctive crest on the head and a mask on the face which is black in the male and gray in the female.
The male is a vibrant red, while the female is a dull red-brown shade.
The Northern Cardinal is mainly granivorous, but also feeds on insects and fruit.
The male behaves territorially, marking out his territory with song.
During courtship, the male feeds seed to the female beak-to-beak.
A clutch of three to four eggs is laid, and two to four clutches are produced each year.
It was once prized as a pet, but its sale as cage birds is now banned in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.
Surface runoff, also called nonpoint source pollution, from a farm field in Iowa during a rain storm.
Topsoil as well as farm fertilizers and other potential pollutants run off unprotected farm fields when heavy rains occur.
Topsoil is the upper, outermost layer of soil, usually the top to.
It has the highest concentration of organic matter and microorganisms and is where most of the Earth 's biological soil activity occurs.

Saint Rita of Cascia ( Born Margherita Lotti 1381 - May 22, 1457 ) was an Italian Augustinian nun, widow and saint venerated in the Roman Catholic Church.
Rita was married at an early age.
The marriage lasted for 18 years, during which she is remembered for her Christian values as a model wife and mother who made efforts to convert her husband from his abusive behavior.
Upon the murder of her husband by another feuding family, she sought to dissuade her sons from revenge.
She subsequently joined an Augustinian community of religious sisters, where she was known for practicing mortification of the flesh, along with the apparent efficacy of her prayers.
St. Rita is venerated due to various miracles attributed to her intercession, and is often portrayed with a bleeding wound on her forehead, which the Roman Catholic Church claims to have been a partial stigmata.
The Roman Catholic Church, under the pontificate of Pope Leo XIII officially canonized Rita on May 24, 1900, while her feast day is celebrated every May 22.
In many pious Catholic countries, Rita is known to be a patroness for abused wives and mourning women.
North America is a continent wholly within the Northern Hemisphere and almost wholly within the Western Hemisphere.
It is also considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas.
It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.
North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers ( 9,540,000 square miles ), about 4.8 % of the planet 's surface or about 16.5 % of its land area.
As of July 2008, its population was estimated at nearly 529 million people across 23 independent states, representing about 7.5 % of the human population.
North America is the third-largest continent in area, following Asia and Africa, and the fourth in population after Asia, Africa, and Europe.
The first people to live in North America were Paleoindians who began to arrive during the last glacial period by crossing the Bering land bridge.
They differentiated into a number of diverse cultures and communities across the continent.
The largest and most advanced Pre-Columbian civilizations in North America were the Aztecs in what is now Mexico and the Mayans in Central America.
European colonists began to arrive starting in the 16th and 17th centuries, wiping out large numbers of the native populations and beginning an era of European dominance.
Jermaine Lamarr Cole ( born January 28, 1985 ), better known by his stage name J. Cole, is an American hip-hop recording artist and record producer from Fayetteville, North Carolina.
In 2009, he became the first artist to sign to Jay-Z 's Roc Nation label.
His long-awaited debut album, entitled Cole World : The Sideline Story, was released on September 27, 2011.
The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, Top R & B Albums and Top Rap Albums chart, selling more than 218,000 in its first week.
He received a nomination for Best New Artist at the 54th Grammy Awards.
The two main characters of the series, Ratchet ( right ) and Clank ( left ).
Ratchet & Clank is a series of platform video games.
The franchise was created and developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for many different PlayStation consoles, such as PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 with the exclusion of Size Matters and Secret Agent Clank, which were developed by High Impact Games for the PlayStation Portable.
Every game in the series has been released for every console, as the IP is owned by Sony Computer Entertainment.
An animated feature film adaptation produced by Rainmaker Entertainment and Blockade Entertainment is scheduled for a theatrical release sometime in 2015.
The games take place in a science fiction setting and follow the adventures of Ratchet ( an animalistic human-like character known as a Lombax, who is a mechanic ) and Clank ( a diminutive, sentient robot ) as they travel through the universe, saving it from evil forces on a regular basis.
The series is noted for the inclusion of many exotic and unique, over the top weapons and devices, a concept that Insomniac Games also expanded into their other games.
A will or testament is a legal declaration by which a person, the testator, names one or more persons to manage his/her estate and provides for the transfer of his property at death.
For the devolution of property not disposed of by will, see inheritance and intestacy.
In the strictest sense, a `` will '' has historically been limited to real property while `` testament '' applies only to dispositions of personal property ( thus giving rise to the popular title of the document as `` Last Will and Testament '' ), though this distinction is seldom observed today.
A will may also create a testamentary trust that is effective only after the death of the testator.
The 19.9 MW Gemasolar solar plant in Spain features 15 hours of storage and can supply power 24 hours a day.
Solar energy, radiant light and heat from the sun, has been harnessed by humans since ancient times using a range of ever-evolving technologies.
Solar energy technologies include solar heating, solar photovoltaics, solar thermal electricity, solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis, which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent energy problems the world now faces.
Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy.
Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy.
Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.
In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that `` the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits.
It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise.
These advantages are global.
Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments ; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared ''.
Sir Thomas More ( ; 7 February 14786 July 1535 ), known to Roman Catholics as Saint Thomas More since 1935, was an English lawyer, social philosopher, author, statesman, and noted Renaissance humanist.
He was an important councillor to Henry VIII of England and was Lord Chancellor from October 1529 to 16 May 1532.
He was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935 as one of the early martyrs of the schism that separated the Church of England from Rome in the 16th century.
In 2000, Pope John Paul II declared him patron of Catholic statesmen and politicians.
More was an opponent of the Protestant Reformation, in particular of Martin Luther and William Tyndale.
However, since 1980, he is also commemorated by the Church of England as a reformation martyr.
More coined the word `` utopia `` – a name he gave to the ideal and imaginary island nation, the political system of which he described in Utopia, published in 1516.
He opposed the King 's separation from the Roman Catholic Church and refused to accept him as Supreme Head of the Church of England, a title which had been given by parliament through the Act of Supremacy of 1534.
He was imprisoned in 1534 for his refusal to take the oath required by the First Succession Act, because the act disparaged Papal Authority and Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon.
In 1535, he was tried for treason, convicted on perjured testimony, and beheaded.
More also helped to originate the phrase `` grasp at straws '' to mean `` desperately trying even useless things '', in his Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation.
Intellectuals and statesmen across Europe were stunned by More 's execution.
Erasmus saluted him as one `` whose soul was more pure than any snow, whose genius was such that England never had and never again will have its like ''.
There was a more controversial side to More 's life, because he advocated the persecution and execution of Protestants who refused to recant their faith.
However, the judgement of history has been largely willing to forgive this in light of the times he lived in and his martyrdom in the Roman Catholic cause.
Two centuries later Jonathan Swift said More was `` the person of the greatest virtue this kingdom ever produced '', a sentiment with which Samuel Johnson agreed.
Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper said in 1977 that More was `` the first great Englishman whom we feel that we know, the most saintly of humanists, the most human of saints, the universal man of our cool northern renaissance. ''
Captain Nemo, also known as Prince Dakkar, is a fictional character invented by the French science fiction author Jules Verne.
Nemo appears in two of Verne 's novels, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea ( 1870 ) and The Mysterious Island ( 1874 ), and makes a cameo appearance in Verne 's play Journey Through the Impossible ( 1882 ).
Nemo, one of the most famous antiheroes in fiction, is a mysterious figure.
The son of an Indian Raja, he is a scientific genius who roams the depths of the sea in his submarine, the Nautilus, which was built on a deserted island.
Nemo tries to project a stern, controlled confidence, but he is driven by a thirst for vengeance and a hatred of imperialism ( particularly the British Empire ).
He is also wracked by remorse over the deaths of his crew members and even by the deaths of enemy sailors.
Nemo has appeared in various adaptations of Verne 's novels, including films, where he has been portrayed by a number of different actors.
He has furthermore been adopted by other authors for inclusion in their novels, most notably in Alan Moore 's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Philip José Farmer 's The Other Log of Phileas Fogg.

Acoustic coupler modem
A modem ( modulator-demodulator ) is a device that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information, and also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information.
The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data.
Modems can be used over any means of transmitting analog signals, from light emitting diodes to radio.
The most familiar example is a voice band modem that turns the digital data of a personal computer into modulated electrical signals in the voice frequency range of a telephone channel.
These signals can be transmitted over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data.
Modems are generally classified by the amount of data they can send in a given unit of time, usually expressed in bits per second ( bit/s, or bps ), or bytes per second ( B/s ).
Modems can alternatively be classified by their symbol rate, measured in baud.
The baud unit denotes symbols per second, or the number of times per second the modem sends a new signal.
For example, the ITU V.21 standard used audio frequency shift keying with two possible frequencies corresponding to two distinct symbols ( or one bit per symbol ), to carry 300 bits per second using 300 baud.
By contrast, the original ITU V.22 standard, which was able to transmit and receive four distinct symbols ( two bits per symbol ), handled 1,200 bit/s by sending 600 symbols per second ( 600 baud ) using phase shift keying.
The Declaration of Independence is a statement adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies, then at war with Great Britain, regarded themselves as independent states, and no longer a part of the British Empire.
Instead they now formed a new nation—the United States of America.
John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence, which was unanimously approved on July 2.
A committee had already drafted the formal declaration, to be ready when congress voted on independence.
Adams persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document, which congress would edit to produce the final version.
The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.
The national birthday, the Independence Day is celebrated on July 4, although Adams wanted July 2.
After ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms.
It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public.
The most famous version of the Declaration, a signed copy that is popularly regarded as the Declaration of Independence, is displayed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.
Although the wording of the Declaration was approved on July 4, the date of its signing was August 2.
The original July 4 United States Declaration of Independence manuscript was lost while all other copies have been derived from this original document.
The sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry.
The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against King George III, and by asserting certain natural and legal rights, including a right of revolution.
Having served its original purpose in announcing independence, the text of the Declaration was initially ignored after the American Revolution.
Since then, it has come to be considered a major statement on human rights, particularly its second sentence:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
This has been called `` one of the best-known sentences in the English language '', containing `` the most potent and consequential words in American history. ''
The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive.
This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln, who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy, and argued that the Declaration is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted.
It has inspired work for the rights of marginalized people throughout the world.
The Economy of Greenland can be characterized as small, mixed and vulnerable.
The present economy consists of a big public sector and comprehensive foreign trade, which has resulted in an economy with periods of strong growth, considerable inflation, unemployment problems and extreme dependence on capital inflow from Denmark and use of outside, mainly Danish, skilled labor.
GDP per capita is similar to the average European economies but the economy is critically dependent upon substantial support from the Danish government, which supplies about half the revenues of the home rule government who in turn employ about 8,000 Greenlanders out of a labor force of 40,156 ( Jan. 2012 ).
Unemployment nonetheless remains high, with the rest of the economy dependent upon demand for exports of shrimp and fish.
Hydrogen is a chemical element with symbol H and atomic number 1.
With an atomic weight of ( for hydrogen-1 ), hydrogen is the lightest element and its monatomic form ( H1 ) is the most abundant chemical substance, constituting roughly 75 % of the Universe 's baryonic mass.
Non- remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state.
At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2.
Most of the hydrogen on Earth is in molecules such as water and organic compounds because hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements.
Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry with many reactions exchanging protons between soluble molecules.
In ionic compounds, it can take a negative charge ( an anion known as a hydride and written as H− ), or as a positively charged species H+.
The latter cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds always occur as more complex species.
The most common isotope of hydrogen is protium ( name rarely used, symbol 1H ) with a single proton and no neutrons.
As the simplest atom known, the hydrogen atom has been of theoretical use.
For example, as the only neutral atom with an analytic solution to the Schrödinger equation, the study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.
Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century, via the mixing of metals with acids.
In 1766–81, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, a property which later gave it its name : in Greek, hydrogen means `` water-former ''.
Industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like the electrolysis of water.
Most hydrogen is employed near its production site, with the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing ( e.g., hydrocracking ) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market.
Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.
Unstoppable is a 2010 American action thriller film directed by Tony Scott, written by Mark Bomback, and starring Denzel Washington and Chris Pine.
The film, loosely based on the real-life CSX 8888 incident, tells the story of a runaway freight train, and the two men ( Washington and Pine ) who manage to stop it.
It was Scott 's final feature film before his death in 2012.
The film was released in the United States and Canada on November 12, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on November 24, 2010.
It received mostly favorable reviews from film critics ; it garnered a `` Certified Fresh '' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based upon aggregated reviews and a rating of `` Generally favorable reviews '' at Metacritic.
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Editing at the 83rd Academy Awards, but lost to Inception.
In photography, bracketing is the general technique of taking several shots of the same subject using different camera settings.
Bracketing is useful and often recommended in situations that make it difficult to obtain a satisfactory image with a single shot, especially when a small variation in exposure parameters has a comparatively large effect on the resulting image.
Autobracketing is automatic bracketing by using a setting on the camera to take several bracketed shots ( in contrast to the photographer altering the settings by hand between each shot ).
Given the time it takes to accomplish multiple shots, it is typically, but not always, used for static subjects.
Insulated glazing ( IG ), more commonly known as double glazing ( or double-pane, and increasingly triple glazing/pane ) are double or triple glass window panes separated by an air or other gas filled space to reduce heat transfer across a part of the building envelope.
Insulated Glass Units are manufactured with glass in range of thickness from 3 mm to 10 mm or more in special applications.
Laminated or tempered glass may also be used as part of the construction.
Most units are manufactured with the same thickness of glass used on both panes but special applications such as acoustic attenuation or security may require wide ranges of thicknesses to be incorporated in the same unit.
A sectioned diagram of a fixed Insulated Glazed Unit ( IGU ), indicating the numbering convention used in this article.
Surface # 1 is facing outside, Surface # 2 is the inside surface of the exterior pane, Surface # 3 is the outside surface of the interior pane, and Surface # 4 is the inside surface of interior pane.
The window frame is labelled # 5, a spacer is indicated as # 6, seals are shown in red ( # 7 ), the internal reveal is on the right hand side ( # 8 ) and the exterior windowsill on the left ( # 9 )
To reduce shear effects on the sealed unit ( a major cause of premature failure ), manufacturers use a rule of thumb that permits a difference of 1 mm between the thickness of the panes of glass used in the unit and still maintain the warranty for the unit.
For example, a unit may be ordered with a 4 mm pane on the exterior and a 3 mm pane on the interior.
These variations are allowed for architectural and cost reasons.
Other combinations can be specified and produced but the manufacturer may reserve the right to limit the term of the warranty or refuse to warranty the unit altogether.
For ease of description the surfaces of a double paned unit are named according to the following convention : Surface # 1 ( facing outside ), Surface # 2 ( inside of outside pane ), Surface # 3 ( outside of inside pane ) and Surface # 4 ( inside surface of inside pane ).
Applying the corresponding nomenclature for triple paned units results in surfaces # 1 through # 6.
The performance of insulating glazing can be modified through the use of the following:
A typical installation of insulated glazing windows with uPVC window frames.
Selenium is a chemical element with symbol Se and atomic number 34.
It is a nonmetal with properties that are intermediate between those of its periodic table column-adjacent chalcogen elements sulfur and tellurium.
It rarely occurs in its elemental state in nature, or as pure ore compounds.
Selenium ( Greek σελήνη selene meaning `` Moon '' ) was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously-known tellurium ( named for the Earth ).
Selenium is found impurely in metal sulfide ores, where it partially replaces the sulfur.
Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during copper production.
Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known, but are rare.
The chief commercial uses for selenium today are in glassmaking and in pigments.
Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells.
Uses in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices.
Selenium continues to be used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.
Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms, including all animals.
Selenium is a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase ( which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants ).
It is also found in three deiodinase enzymes, which convert one thyroid hormone to another.
Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, with some plants requiring relatively large amounts, and others apparently requiring none.
The United States presidential election of 2008 was the 56th quadrennial presidential election.
It was held on Tuesday, November 4, 2008.
Democrat Barack Obama, then the junior Senator from Illinois, defeated Republican John McCain, the senior Senator from Arizona.
As the campaign progressed, the War in Iraq and outgoing Republican President George W. Bush had become increasingly unpopular, and the major-party candidates ran on a platform of change and reform.
Domestic policy and the economy eventually emerged as the main themes in the last few months of the election campaign after the onset of the worst recession since the 1930s.
Obama would go on to win a decisive victory over McCain in both the electoral and popular vote.
Obama received the most votes for a presidential candidate in American history, and won the popular and electoral vote by the largest margin in 12 years, as well as the largest percentage of the popular vote for a Democrat in nearly a half-century.
This was the first U.S. presidential election in which an African American was elected, having also been the first in which an African American won the nomination of either major party.
This election was also notable for being the first time in U.S. history that both major party candidates were sitting U.S. Senators, only the third time ( after 1920 and 1960 ) that any sitting U.S. Senator was elected president, and only the second time that the winning President and Vice President ( Obama and Biden ) were both sitting U.S. Senators.
This was also the first election since 1952 in which neither of the major parties ' nominees was the incumbent President or Vice President.
The Sovereign Prince or Princess of Monaco is the reigning monarch and head of state of the Principality of Monaco.
All princes or princesses have officially taken the name of the House of Grimaldi, but have belonged to various other houses ( Goyon de Matignon, Polignac ) in male line.
The reigning Prince is Albert II.
Visualization of fragmentation and then of defragmentation
In the maintenance of file systems, defragmentation is a process that reduces the amount of fragmentation.
It does this by physically organizing the contents of the mass storage device used to store files into the smallest number of contiguous regions ( fragments ).
It also attempts to create larger regions of free space using compaction to impede the return of fragmentation.
Some defragmentation utilities try to keep smaller files within a single directory together, as they are often accessed in sequence.
Defragmentation is advantageous and relevant to file systems on electromechanical disk drives.
The movement of the hard drive 's read/write heads over different areas of the disk when accessing fragmented files is slower, compared to accessing the entire contents of a non-fragmented file sequentially without moving the read/write heads to seek other fragments.
A service-level agreement ( SLA ) is a part of a service contract where a service is formally defined.
In practice, the term SLA is sometimes used to refer to the contracted delivery time ( of the service or performance ).
As an example, internet service providers will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level ( s ) of service being sold in plain language terms.
In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition in terms of mean time between failures ( MTBF ), mean time to repair or mean time to recovery ( MTTR ) ; various data rates ; throughput ; jitter ; or similar measurable details.
Union Station is a former shopping mall in Union City, Georgia, in southwest metro Atlanta adjacent to Interstate 85.
After new ownership and renovations in 2006, the name was changed from Shannon Southpark Mall in 2007 to Union Station Mall.
A previous renovation was done in the late 1990s.
The mall has been closed since November 2010.
This map shows the contiguous United States and, in insets at the lower left, the two states that are not contiguous.
The contiguous United States are the 48 adjoining U.S. states on the continent of North America that are south of Canada and north of Mexico, plus the District of Columbia.
The term excludes the states of Alaska and Hawaii, and all off-shore U.S. territories and possessions, such as Puerto Rico.
Together, the 48 contiguous states and D.C. occupy a combined area of, which is 1.58 % of the total surface area of the Earth.
Of this, is land, composing 83.65 % of U.S. land area.
Officially, is water area, composing 62.66 % of the nation 's water area.
The 2010 census population was 306,675,006, composing 99.33 % of the nation 's population, and a density of 103.639 inhabitants/sq mi ( 40.015/km2 ), compared to 87.264/sq mi ( 33.692/km2 ) for the nation as a whole.
`` Why '' is the title of a song recorded by American country band Rascal Flatts.
It is the third single from their sixth studio album, Unstoppable.
It was released to radio stations on September 29, 2009 and debuted at # 44 on the U.S. Billboard US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of October 10, 2009.
It was written by Rob Mathes and Allen Shamblin.
Utilization management is the evaluation of the appropriateness, medical need and efficiency of health care services procedures and facilities according to established criteria or guidelines and under the provisions of an applicable health benefits plan.
Typically it includes new activities or decisions based upon the analysis of a case.
Utilization management describes proactive procedures, including discharge planning, concurrent planning, pre-certification and clinical case appeals.
It also covers proactive processes, such as concurrent clinical reviews and peer reviews, as well as appeals introduced by the provider, payer or patient.
As pre-certification and concurrent review of cases grew, utilization management spun out of utilization review.
While not synonymous, health care professionals tend to use the terms as interchangeable.
The difference is utilization management is and intends to manage health care cases efficiently and cost effectively before and during health care administration.
Utilization review is more considering whether health care was appropriately applied after it was administered.
There are four basic techniques in utilization management:
Demand Management
Utilization Review
Case Management
Disease Management
The Outsiders is a coming-of-age novel by S. E. Hinton, first published in 1967 by Viking Press.
Hinton was 15 when she started writing the novel, but did most of the work when she was sixteen and a junior in high school.
Hinton was 18 when the book was published.
The book follows two rival groups, the Greasers and the Socs ( pronounced by the author as, short for Socials ), who are divided by their socioeconomic status.
The book takes place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1965, but it is never stated in the book.
A film adaptation was produced in 1983, and a little-known short-lived television series appeared in 1990, picking up where the movie left off.
The United States House of Representatives is one of the two houses of the United States Congress ( a bicameral legislature ).
It is frequently referred to as the House.
The other house is the Senate.
The composition and powers of the House are established in Article One of the United States Constitution.
The major power of the House is to pass federal legislation that affects the entire country although its bills must also be passed by the Senate and further agreed to by the U.S. President before becoming law ( unless both the House and Senate re-pass the legislation with a two-thirds majority in each chamber ).
The House has several exclusive powers : the power to initiate revenue bills, to impeach officials, and to elect the U.S. President in case there is no majority in the Electoral College.
Each U.S. state is represented in the House in proportion to its population but is entitled to at least one representative.
The most populous state, California, currently has 53 representatives.
The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435.
Each representative serves for a two-year term.
The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, who presides over the chamber, is elected by the members of the House, and is therefore traditionally the leader of the House Democratic Caucus or the House Republican Conference, whichever party has more voting members.
The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol.
A supply chain is actually a complex and dynamic supply and demand network.
( cf. Wieland/Wallenburg, 2011 )
A supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer.
Supply chain activities transform natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer.
In sophisticated supply chain systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable.
Supply chains link value chains.
`` Purple Haze '' is a song written and recorded by Jimi Hendrix in 1967, released as the second single by The Jimi Hendrix Experience in both the United Kingdom and the United States.
It later appeared on the American version of the band 's 1967 album Are You Experienced.
`` Purple Haze '' has become one of the `` archetypical psychedelic drug songs of the sixties ''.
`` Purple Haze 's '' guitar virtuosic techniques would be emulated by many metal guitarists.
A close up picture of a rhinoceros skin.
Skin is the soft outer covering of vertebrates.
Other animal coverings such as the arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition.
The adjective cutaneous means `` of the skin '' ( from Latin cutis, skin ).
In mammals, the skin is the largest organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs.
Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds.
All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals which appear to be hairless.
The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors.
For example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss.
Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin D folates.
Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue.
This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented.
The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism.
In humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as `` crows feet '' and wrinkles.
The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and the thickest skin in the body.
Fur is dense hair.
Primarily, fur augments the insulation the skin provides but can also serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage.
On some animals, the skin is very hard and thick, and can be processed to create leather.
Reptiles and fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection, and birds have hard feathers, all made of tough β- keratins.
Amphibian skin is not a strong barrier to passage of chemicals and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces.
For example, a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly, as the chemical diffuses through its skin.
Thomas Scott
The Rev. Thomas Scott ( 1747-1821 ) was an influential preacher and author who is principally known for his best-selling work A Commentary On The Whole Bible and The Force of Truth, and as one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society.
Daniel Radcliffe, who portrays Harry Potter, has been the icon of the film series since the release of the first film in 2001.
Some of the most renowned actors of the United Kingdom and Ireland have voiced or portrayed characters appearing in the Harry Potter film series based on the book series by J. K. Rowling.
Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have played Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in all the films.
When they were cast only Radcliffe had previously acted in a film.
Complementing them on screen are such actors as Helena Bonham Carter, Jim Broadbent, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Griffiths, Richard Harris, John Hurt, Jason Isaacs, Miriam Margolyes, Helen McCrory, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, and Julie Walters, among others.
Thirteen actors have appeared as the same character in all eight films of the franchise.
Some well-known British actors who have not appeared in the series, are asked in jest why they have not been cast.
When David Yates was directing the fifth film, Bill Nighy, who had previously collaborated with Yates on three of his television projects, said that he joked with Yates that maybe now he would n't be the only actor in England who had n't been in Harry Potter.
`` But nobody called '', Nighy added.
But in 2009, Yates cast Nighy as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in Deathly Hallows.
Nighy said, `` I am no longer the only English actor not to be in Harry Potter and I am very pleased. ''

With the exception of Chris Columbus, each director has had a cameo appearance in his respective film : Alfonso Cuarón appears as a wizard holding a candle during a scene at The Three Broomsticks in Prisoner of Azkaban ; Mike Newell is heard briefly as the radio presenter in Frank Bryce 's house in Goblet of Fire ; and David Yates features as a wizard within a magical moving portrait in Order of the Phoenix.
Producer David Heyman also makes a cameo appearance as a wizard featured within a magical moving portrait in the third film, Prisoner of Azkaban.
J. K. Rowling gave a speech during the world premiere of the final film in the series— Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 —on 7 July 2011 in London, England.
She announced that she could never have dreamt of the talented actors and actresses who have appeared in all the Harry Potter movies.
Rowling also announced that there are seven Harry Potter film series cast members, who she refers to as `` The Big Seven '', they are Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Matthew Lewis, Evanna Lynch and Bonnie Wright.
The list below is sorted by film and character, as some characters have been portrayed by multiple actors.
Key
( v ) indicates the actor or actress lent only his or her voice for his or her film character
( y ) indicates the actor or actress portrayed the role in a flashback scene or when the character was young.
( f ) indicates the actor or actress did not appear in any new footage for the film ; footage from an earlier film or films was used.
A light grey cell ( such as the one in the `` Charity Burbage '' row in the `` Philosopher 's Stone '' column ) indicates the character was not in the film adaptation.
A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles ( accepted by members as 'spiritual principles, ' based on the approved literature ) outlining a course of action for recovery from, compulsion, or other behavioral problems.
Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA ) as a method of recovery from alcoholism, the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous : The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939.
The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs.
As summarized by the American Psychological Association, the process involves the following:
admitting that one can not control one 's addiction or compulsion ;
recognizing a higher power that can give strength ;
examining past errors with the help of a sponsor ( experienced member ) ;
making amends for these errors ;
learning to live a new life with a new code of behavior ;
helping others who suffer from the same addictions or compulsions.

The Federal Rules of Evidence contain the rules governing impeachment in federal courts.
Party leaders and whips of the United States House of Representatives are elected by their respective parties in a closed-door caucus by secret ballot and are also known as floor leaders.
The U.S. House of Representatives does not officially use the term `` Minority Leader '' although the media frequently do.
The House instead uses the terms `` Republican Leader '' or `` Democratic Leader '' depending on which party holds a minority of seats.
The current House Majority Leader is Republican Eric Cantor, while the current House Minority Leader is Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
The current House Majority Whip is Republican Kevin McCarthy, while the current House Minority Whip is Democrat Steny Hoyer.
Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the German Army opened the Western Front by first invading Luxembourg and Belgium, then gaining military control of important industrial regions in France.
The tide of the advance was dramatically turned with the Battle of the Marne.
Following the race to the sea, both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches, stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France.
This line remained essentially unchanged for most of the war.
Between 1915 and 1917 there were several major offensives along this front.
The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances.
However, a combination of entrenchments, machine gun nests, barbed wire, and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties on the attackers and counterattacking defenders.
As a result, no significant advances were made.
Among the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun with a combined [ estimated ] 700,000 dead, the Battle of the Somme with more than [ an estimated ] million casualties, and the Battle of Passchendaele with roughly [ an estimated ] 600,000 casualties.
In an effort to break the deadlock, this front saw the introduction of new military technology, including poison gas, aircraft and tanks.
But it was only after the adoption of improved tactics that some degree of mobility was restored.
The German Spring Offensive of 1918 was made possible by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that marked the end of the conflict on the Eastern Front.
Using the recently-introduced infiltration tactics, the German armies advanced nearly to the west, which marked the deepest advance by either side since 1914 and very nearly succeeded in forcing a breakthrough.
In spite of the generally stagnant nature of this front, this theater would prove decisive.
The inexorable advance of the Allied armies during the second half of 1918 persuaded the German commanders that defeat was inevitable, and the government was forced to sue for conditions of an armistice.
The terms of peace were agreed upon with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.
The following is a list of recurring and minor characters in the Disney Channel Original Series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.
These characters were regularly rotated, often disappearing for long periods during the series.
The following list of characters has been sorted alphabetically, by first name.
Some of the characters had no last name and most were commonly referred to by their first name so this appeared to be the most logical method.
In the case of Chef Paolo, who had no known first name, they have been listed by title.
The First Lady of the United States ( FLOTUS ) is the hostess of the White House.
Because this position is traditionally filled by the wife of the President of the United States, the title is most often applied to the wife of a sitting president.
The current First Lady is Michelle Obama.
After her husband Barack Obama was re-elected on November 6, 2012, she is scheduled to serve until January 20, 2017.
Septic shock is a medical condition as a result of severe infection and sepsis, though the microbe may be systemic or localized to a particular site.
It can cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( formerly known as multiple organ failure ) and death.
Its most common victims are children, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly, as their immune systems can not deal with the infection as effectively as those of healthy adults.
Frequently, patients suffering from septic shock are cared for in intensive care units.
The mortality rate from septic shock is approximately 25–50 %.
Kevin Brereton ( born February 20, 1972 ), better known by his stage name k-os ( ; `` chaos '' ), is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer.
His given name may also be cited as Kheaven, a spelling he later adopted.
The alias `` k-os '', spelled with a lower case `` k '', was intended to be less aggressive than the pseudonyms of other rappers whose names were all upper case, such as KRS-One.
It is an acronym for `` Knowledge of Self, '' although in a later interview he said that it originally stood for `` Kevin 's Original Sound. '' k-os ' music incorporates a wide variety of music genres, including rap, funk, rock, and reggae.
The lyrics frequently focus on promoting a `` positive message '' while at times expressing criticism of mainstream hip hop culture 's obsession with money, fame and glorification of violence.
A musician as well as a producer, k-os has written and produced nearly every part of all four of his albums.
k-os usually performs with a live band, something that is uncommon in the hip hop genre.
He sometimes plays guitar and keyboard both during live performances and in the studio.
k-os received his first musical exposure with the single `` Musical Essence '', released in 1993.
After the release of his second single `` Rise Like the Sun '' in 1996, he withdrew from the industry because he was dissatisfied with his musical style.
He reappeared briefly in 1999 and released his debut album Exit in 2002.
The album received positive reviews but sold relatively few copies.
He released his second album Joyful Rebellion in 2004, which received platinum status in Canada.
A third album,, was released in 2006 and also went platinum.
His fourth album, Yes !
, was released in 2009.
His fifth album BLack on BLonde was released in 2013.
The official 2007 edition of the UCC.
Even the confidential rough drafts of the UCC were saved and published as a 10-volume set.
The Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC or the Code ), first published in 1952, is one of a number of uniform acts that have been promulgated in conjunction with efforts to harmonize the law of sales and other commercial transactions in all 50 states within the United States of America.
Multi-pitch climbing is the ascent of climbing routes with one or more stops at a belay station.
Each section of actual climbing between stops at the belay stations is called a pitch.
The leader ascends the pitch, placing gear and stopping to anchor themselves to the belay station.
The reason for the stops can be determined by choice, convention or necessity.
For example:
The rope is too short to do the entire route in one pitch ( necessity ).
The leader has run out of protective gear ( necessity ).
There is a convenient protectable ledge, or fixed bolts placed by previous climbers, at the location for a belay station ( convention ).
The leader chooses to rest or exchange leads before the next section of the climb ( choice ).
The general purpose of these stops is to allow the second to ascend to the point of the lead climber while collecting the protective gear from the route in the course of the lead climber 's ascent.
At the belay station, the protective gear is collected, possibly exchanged to a new leader, and the leader of the next pitch ascends the route.
A diagram showing an I Formation on offense and a 4-3 Formation on defense
In American football, each team has eleven players on the field at one time.
The specific role that a player takes on the field is called their position.
Under the modern rules of American football, teams are allowed unlimited subsititutions, that is teams may change any number of players after any play.
This has resulted in the development of three `` platoons '' of players, the offense ( the team with the ball, who is trying to score ), the defense ( the team trying to prevent the other team from scoring, and to take the ball from them ), and the special teams ( who play in kicking situations ).
Within those platoons, various specific positions exist depending on what the player 's main job is.
The Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) was enacted into law by the Congress of the United States as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970.
The CSA is the federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and distribution of certain substances is regulated.
The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
The legislation created five Schedules ( classifications ), with varying qualifications for a substance to be included in each.
Two federal agencies, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Food and Drug Administration, determine which substances are added to or removed from the various schedules, though the statute passed by Congress created the initial listing, and Congress has sometimes scheduled other substances through legislation such as the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Prevention Act of 2000, which placed gamma hydroxybutyrate in Schedule I. Classification decisions are required to be made on criteria including potential for abuse ( an undefined term ), currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and international treaties.
The Wayne Route 23 Transit Center is a New Jersey Transit park-and-ride station in Wayne, New Jersey along the Montclair-Boonton Line that provides bus service to New York City and various other points in the area as well as Montclair-Boonton Line train service to New York, Hoboken, and intermediate points along the line between Hackettstown and Montclair State University.
It is located off of the southbound lanes of New Jersey Route 23 on West Belt Road, near the interchange where Route 23, Interstate 80, and U.S. Route 46 meet, across from the Willowbrook Mall.
The station opened in January 2008 and has 1,000 parking spaces.
New Jersey Transit intends for this combined rail and bus station to become an `` interceptor station, '' that will help relieve the habitual congestion at the West Belt Road Interchange, where the three major highways meet.
In addition, the construction of the station was meant to also ease the congestion at what was then Route 23 Park & Ride, a bus depot on Route 23 North that has since been renamed Mother 's Park & Ride, and the Willowbrook Mall Park & Ride ; the now-Mother 's site had limited parking while NJT was having trouble with overfull parking areas at Willowbrook.
The Wayne Township bus garage is located on the opposite side of Route 23.
There has been a proposal to build a parking deck with another thousand spots and develop the land at the station.
In addition to Montclair-Boonton trains, the Transit Center is served by the following New Jersey Transit bus lines:
75 to Newark Penn Station and Butler
194 to Port Authority Bus Terminal and Butler/Newfoundland
198 to Port Authority Bus Terminal and William Paterson University
324 to Port Authority and Wayne Route 23
748 to Willowbrook Mall and Paterson
The at sign @ is also commonly called the at symbol, ampersat, apetail or commercial at in English—and less commonly a wide range of other terms.
The fact that there is no single word in English for the symbol has prompted some writers to use the French arobase or Spanish and Portuguese arroba—or to coin new words such as asperand, ampersat—but none of these has achieved wide currency.
Originally an accounting and commercial invoice abbreviation meaning `` at the rate of '' ( e.g. 7 widgets @ $ 2 = $ 14 ), it was not included on the keyboard of the earliest commercially successful typewriters, but was on at least one 1889 model and the very successful Underwood models from the `` Underwood No. 5 '' in 1900 onward.
It is now universally included on computer keyboards.
In recent years, its meaning has grown to include the sense of being `` located at, '' `` and, '' or `` directed at '', especially in email addresses and social media, particularly Twitter.

The Catcher in the Rye is a 1951 novel by J. D. Salinger.
Originally published for adults, it has since become popular with adolescent readers for its themes of teenage angst and alienation.
It has been translated into almost all of the world 's major languages.
Around 250,000 copies are sold each year with total sales of more than 65 million books.
The novel 's protagonist and antihero, Holden Caulfield, has become an icon for teenage rebellion.
The novel was included on Times 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.
It has been frequently challenged in the United States and other countries for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality.
It also deals with complex issues of identity, belonging, connection, and alienation.
Skeletal muscles homo sapiens
This is a table of muscles of the human anatomy.
There are approximately 642 skeletal muscles within the typical human, and almost every muscle constitutes one part of a pair of identical bilateral muscles, found on both sides, resulting in approximately 320 pairs of muscles, as presented in this article.
Nevertheless, the exact number is difficult to define because different sources group muscles differently, e.g. regarding what is defined as different parts of a single muscle or as several muscles.
Examples range from 640 to 850.
The muscles of the human body can be categorized into a number of groups which include muscles relating to the head and neck, muscles of the torso or trunk, muscles of the upper limbs, and muscles of the lower limbs.
The action refers to the action of each muscle from the standard anatomical position.
In other positions, other actions may be performed.
Bad Girls Club ( BGC ) is an American reality television series created by Jonathan Murray for the Oxygen television station.
The show centers on seven feisty and mischievous women with different backgrounds and personalities, who have a number of psychological and behavioral problems.
They are introduced to the show off their pernicious behavior and accomplish specific goals.
The cast, deemed `` bad girls '', enjoy a luxurious lifestyle in a fine mansion for three months, during which they must obey specified rules.
Their lives inside – and outside – of the house are chronicled and recorded by the production team.
The Bad Girls Club is broadcast in five countries ( United States, Netherlands, Australia, Hungary, and Sweden ).
It has received negative reviews from critics, who believe the show promotes violence by adolescent viewers.
Furthermore, several cast members made controversial remarks which outraged many viewers.
The format of the show has changed from early seasons.
If a `` bad girl '' breaks a rule, she is evicted from the show and, if it is early in the season, replaced by a new `` bad girl ''.
There have been nine complete seasons of The Bad Girls Club, with the tenth season currently airing.
The fourth season had the highest ratings in the show 's history, becoming its `` breakthrough season ''.
There have been three spin-offs of The Bad Girls Club.
One of them, Love Games : Bad Girls Need Love Too, where past cast members seek true love, has gained high ratings.
Oxygen has also released a mobile game, comic strip and merchandise to promote the show.
Of the 92 contestants, Kerry Harvick ( of season one ) was a successful country singer before the show.
Tanisha Thomas ( of season two ) later hosted Oxygen 's OxygenLive !
and the subsequent seasons of Love Games : Bad Girls Need Love Too.
Thomas, who has been dubbed the `` godmother '' to all contestants, has her own television documentary entitled Tanisha Gets Married.
As of Season 8 she 's been the host of the reunion specials.
The Iowa Senate is the upper house of the Iowa General Assembly.
There are 50 seats in the Iowa Senate, representing 50 single-member districts across the state with populations of approximately 60,927 per constituency,.
Each Senate district is composed of two House districts.
The Senate meets at the Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines.
Unlike the lower house, the Iowa House of Representatives, Senators serve four-year terms, with half of the Senate staggered for re-election every two years.
There are no term limits for the Senate.
Mechanical repair
Maintenance, repair, and operations ( MRO ) or maintenance, repair, and overhaul involves fixing any sort of mechanical, plumbing or electrical device should it become out of order or broken ( known as repair, unscheduled or casualty maintenance ).
It also includes performing routine actions which keep the device in working order ( known as scheduled maintenance ) or prevent trouble from arising ( preventive maintenance ).
MRO may be defined as, `` All actions which have the objective of retaining or restoring an item in or to a state in which it can perform its required function.
The actions include the combination of all technical and corresponding administrative, managerial, and supervision actions. ''
MRO operations can be categorised by whether the product remains the property of the customer, i.e. a service is being offered, or whether the product is bought by the reprocessing organisation and sold to any customer wishing to make the purchase ( Guadette, 2002 ).
In the former case it may be a backshop operation within a larger organisation or smaller operation.
The former of these represents a closed loop supply chain and usually has the scope of maintenance, repair or of the product.
The latter of the categorisations is an open loop supply chain and is typified by refurbishment and remanufacture.
The main characteristic of the closed loop system is that the demand for a product is matched with the supply of a used product.
Neglecting asset write-offs and exceptional activities the total population of the product between the customer and the service provider remains constant.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge ( William Arthur Philip Louis ; born 21 June 1982 ), is the elder son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales, and third-eldest grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
He is second in the line of succession, behind his father, to the thrones of sixteen independent sovereign states known as the Commonwealth realms : the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Barbados, The Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis.
Prince William was educated at four schools in the United Kingdom and obtained a degree from the University of St Andrews.
He spent parts of a gap year in Chile, Belize, Tanzania, and Kenya where he has lived and holidayed several times.
Prince William has also taken Kiswahili studies at universities in Kenya and Tanzania.
He was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the Blues and Royals Regiment of the Household Cavalry —serving with his brother Prince Harry —and, two years later, earned his wings by completing pilot training at Royal Air Force College Cranwell.
In 2009, he transferred to the Royal Air Force, was promoted to Flight Lieutenant and underwent helicopter flying training in order to become a full-time pilot with the Search and Rescue Force.
In 2010, he completed his general and special-to-type helicopter training and went on to RAF Valley on No. 22 Squadron performing co-pilot duties on board a Sea King search and rescue helicopter.
Prince William married his longtime girlfriend, Catherine Middleton, on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey.
Hours prior to his wedding, Prince William was created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, and Baron Carrickfergus.
DeAndre Cortez Way ( born July 28, 1990 ), better known by his stage name Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, or simply Soulja Boy, is an American rapper, record producer, actor, and entrepreneur.
In September 2007, his single `` Crank That ( Soulja Boy ) `` reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.
The single was initially self-published on the internet, and it later became a number-one hit in the United States for seven non-consecutive weeks starting in September 2007.
On August 17 Way was listed at # 18 on the Forbes list of Hip-Hop Cash Kings of 2010 earning $ 7 million for that year.
Way has currently released three studio albums and one independent album : his debut studio album Souljaboytellem.com ( 2007 ) was certified platinum by the RIAA.
However, his next two albums, iSouljaBoyTellem ( 2008 ) and The DeAndre Way ( 2010 ) did not match the commercial success of his debut, the latter only selling 100,000 copies, despite the success of several singles across both albums, such as `` Kiss Me Thru the Phone `` and `` Turn My Swag On `` ( iSouljaBoyTellem ) and `` Pretty Boy Swag `` ( The DeAndre Way ).
This was mainly due to negotiation problems with Interscope Records which meant a limited amount of records were made available to the public.
As of 2011, Way has confirmed he is working on his fourth studio album, entitled USA DRE, which will be released in 2013.
The electron transport chain in the mitochondrion is the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes.
The NADH and succinate generated in the citric acid cycle are oxidized, providing energy to power ATP synthase.
Photosynthetic electron transport chain of the thylakoid membrane.
An electron transport chain ( ETC ) couples electron transfer between an electron donor ( such as NADH ) and an electron acceptor ( such as O2 ) with the transfer of H+ ions ( protons ) across a membrane.
The resulting electrochemical proton gradient is used to generate chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ).
Electron transport chains are the cellular mechanisms used for extracting energy from sunlight in photosynthesis and also from redox reactions, such as the oxidation of sugars ( respiration ).
In chloroplasts, light drives the conversion of water to oxygen and NADP+ to NADPH with transfer of H+ ions across chloroplast membranes.
In mitochondria, it is the conversion of oxygen to water, NADH to NAD+ and succinate to fumarate that are required to generate the proton gradient.
Electron transport chains are major sites of premature electron leakage to oxygen, generating superoxide and potentially resulting in increased oxidative stress.
Tramadol hydrochloride ( trademarked as Conzip, Ryzolt, Ultracet, Ultram in the USA, Ralivia, Zytram XL Durella { CR-100/200 mg } in Canada or Adolonta in Spain ) is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain.
The drug has a wide range of applications, including treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, restless legs syndrome, motor neurone disease and fibromyalgia.
It was launched and marketed as Tramal by the German pharmaceutical company Grünenthal GmbH in 1977.
Tramadol is a weak μ-opioid receptor agonist that also induces serotonin release and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine.
Tramadol is metabolized to O-desmethyltramadol, a significantly more potent μ-opioid agonist.
Tramadol and its major metabolite ( s ) are distinguished from other more potent opioid agonists by relative selectivity for μ-opioid receptors.
Bernard Lawrence `` Bernie '' Madoff ( ; born April 29, 1938 ) is an American former stockbroker, investment advisor, financier, and white collar criminal.
He is the former non-executive Chairman of the NASDAQ stock market, and the admitted operator of a Ponzi scheme that is considered to be the largest financial fraud in U.S. history.
Madoff founded the Wall Street firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in 1960, and was its chairman until his arrest on December 11, 2008.
The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street, which bypassed `` specialist '' firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail brokers.
He employed at the firm his brother Peter as Senior Managing Director and Chief Compliance Officer ; Peter has since been sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Peter 's daughter Shana Madoff as the firm 's rules and compliance officer and attorney, and his sons Andrew and Mark ( Mark committed suicide by hanging exactly two years after his father 's arrest ).
On December 10, 2008, Madoff 's sons told authorities that their father had confessed to them that the asset management unit of his firm was a massive Ponzi scheme, and quoted him as describing it as `` one big lie. ''
The following day, FBI agents arrested Madoff and charged him with one count of securities fraud.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) had previously conducted investigations into Madoff 's business practices, but did not uncover the massive fraud.
In March 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies and admitted to turning his wealth management business into a massive Ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors of billions of dollars.
Madoff said he began the Ponzi scheme in the early 1990s.
However, federal investigators believe the fraud began as early as the 1970s, and those charged with recovering the missing money believe the investment operation may never have been legitimate.
The amount missing from client accounts, including fabricated gains, was almost $ 65 billion.
The court-appointed trustee estimated actual losses to investors of $ 18 billion.
On June 29, 2009, he was sentenced to 150 years in prison, the maximum allowed.
Administrative Professionals Day ( also known as Secretaries Day or Admin Day ) is an unofficial secular holiday observed in several countries to recognize the work of secretaries, administrative assistants, receptionists, and other administrative support professionals.
In North America, it is celebrated on the Wednesday of the last full week of April ( April 24 in 2013 ).
In France it is celebrated on the third Thursday in April ( April 18 in 2013 ).
In Australia it is celebrated on the first Friday in May
A quasi-judicial body is an entity such as an arbitrator or tribunal board, generally of a public administrative agency, which has powers and procedures resembling those of a court of law or judge, and which is obligated to objectively determine facts and draw conclusions from them so as to provide the basis of an official action.
Such actions are able to remedy a situation or impose legal penalties, and may affect the legal rights, duties or privileges of specific parties.
Monument of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler in Prague
Tycho Brahe ( 14 December 154624 October 1601 ), born Tyge Ottesen Brahe, was a Danish nobleman known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations.
He was born in Scania, then part of Denmark, now part of modern-day Sweden.
Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer and alchemist.
In his De nova stella ( On the new star ) of 1573, he refuted the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm.
His precise measurements indicated that `` new stars, '' ( stellae novae, now known as supernovae ) in particular that of 1572, lacked the parallax expected in sub-lunar phenomena, and were therefore not `` atmospheric '' tailless comets as previously believed, but were above the atmosphere and moon.
Using similar measurements he showed that comets were also not atmospheric phenomena, as previously thought, and must pass through the supposedly `` immutable '' celestial spheres.
As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe, the Tychonic system.
Furthermore, he was the last of the major naked eye astronomers, working without telescopes for his observations.
Tycho Brahe was granted an estate on the island of Hven and the funding to build the Uraniborg, an early research institute, where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements, and later Stjerneborg, underground, when he discovered that his instruments in the former were not sufficiently steady.
On the island ( on which he demonstrated autocratic character and behavior toward the residents ) he founded manufactories such as paper-making to provide material for printing his results.
After disagreements with the new Danish king Christian IV in 1597, he was invited by the Bohemian king and Holy Roman emperor Rudolph II to Prague, where he became the official imperial astronomer.
He built the new observatory at Benátky nad Jizerou.
Here, from 1600 until his death in 1601, he was assisted by Johannes Kepler who later used Tycho 's astronomical data to develop Kepler 's laws of planetary motion.
Guro District ( Guro-gu ) is a district of Seoul, South Korea, which was separated from Yeongdeungpo District on April 1, 1980.
Located in the southwestern part of the city, where besides Yangcheon District and Geumcheon District Guro District has an important position as a transport link which contains railroads, land routes from the rest of Seoul to the south of the country.
The Gyeongbu and Gyeongin railway lines connect Seoul to Busan and Incheon.
In addition, Seoul Metropolitan Subway lines 1, 2, and 7, and major highways intersect in Guro District.
The name Guro originates from the legend that nine ( ) old men ( Korean : ro ) enjoyed longevity in the district.
A digital industrial complex is located in Guro District.
The Guro Digital Industrial Complex, which played a leading industrial role mainly with textile manufacturing, dressmaking and other labour-intensive industries in 1967, has been rapidly changed into an IT industrial complex.
This complex played a pivotal role in the economic growth of the South Korea 's development era, referred to as the `` Miracle on the Han River ``, and also contributed 10 percent of national export in the 1970s.
Twenty-one percent of the total area of Guro District is a restricted zone to be used as a greenbelt with the only arboretum in Seoul.
The zone is changing into a lively district as large labour-intensive factories are moving from the area and the council is developing what it terms its four zones.
An `` e-government `` system based on this hosted the international e-participation forum on February 7–9, 2007, with the participation of more than thirty-seven countries.
The forum was launched with the theme `` Promoting Democracy and Regional Development '' and twenty-five mayors including André Santini ( Issy-les-Moulineaux, France ), Kevin Foy ( Chapel Hill, US ), Apirak Kosayothin ( Bangkok, Thailand ), Uvais Mohamed Emthiyas ( Colombo, Sri Lanka ), and world experts such as Dr William H. Dutton ( Director of Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford, UK ) and Dr Ari-Veiko Anttiroiko ( professor at the University of Tampere, Finland ) participated in the forum.
The Guro Declaration, adopted during the forum, aims to set up a portal site for e-government development and to establish a concrete project in order to bridge the digital divide among the world 's cities.
This practice has been recognised for providing a new important step in the development of e-democracy.
The e-participation forum was a key factor for Guro to play the leading role in bridging the digital divide among cities, to provide I.T. enterprises located in Guro Digital Industrial Complex the opportunity to launch into the international market, to improve its image and become a global leader to concrete e-democracy.

A wonton ( also spelled wantan, wanton, or wuntun in transcription from Cantonese ; Mandarin : húndùn ) is a type of dumpling commonly found in a number of Chinese cuisines.
Many people were involved in the invention of radio as we now know it.
Several possible methods of wireless communication were considered, including inductive and capacitive induction and transmission through the ground, however the method used for radio today exclusively involves the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves.
After early speculation on the subject, experimental work on the connection between electricity and magnetism began around 1820 with the work of Hans Christian Ørsted and continued with the work of André-Marie Ampère, Joseph Henry, and Michael Faraday.
These investigations culminated in the complete theory of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell.
This theory described the theoretical basis of the propagation of electromagnetic waves.
After Maxwell 's theory was published many people experimented with wireless communication, some intentionally using Maxwell 's theory some not.
It is considered likely that the first intentional transmission of a signal by means of electromagnetic waves was performed by David Edward Hughes around 1880, although this was considered to be induction at the time.
The first systematic and unequivocal transmission of EM waves was performed by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz and described in papers published in 1887 and 1890.
Hertz famously considered these results as being of little practical value.
After Hertz 's work many people were involved in the development of components and theory involved with the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves.
Others, notably Guglielmo Marconi, were concerned with practical improvements and the commercial application of radio to wireless telegraphy.
Later on Reginald A. Fessenden became the first to send an audio signal by means of electromagnetic waves.
Scurvy is a disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C, which is required for the synthesis of collagen in humans.
The chemical name for vitamin C, ascorbic acid, is derived from the Latin name of scurvy, scorbutus, which also provides the adjective scorbutic ( `` of, characterized by or having to do with scurvy '' ).
Scurvy often presents itself initially as symptoms of malaise and lethargy, followed by formation of spots on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding from the mucous membranes.
Spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a person with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially immobilized.
As scurvy advances, there can be open, suppurating wounds, loss of teeth, jaundice, fever, neuropathy and death.
Scurvy was at one time common among sailors, pirates and others aboard ships at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored ( subsisting instead only on cured and salted meats and dried grains ) and by soldiers similarly deprived of these foods for extended periods.
It was described by Hippocrates ( c. 460 BC–c. 380 BC ), and herbal cures for scurvy have been known in many native cultures since prehistory.
Scurvy was one of the limiting factors of marine travel, often killing large numbers of the passengers and crew on long-distance voyages.
This became a significant issue in Europe from the beginning of the modern era in the Age of Discovery in the 15th century, continuing to play a significant role through World War I in the 20th century.
While today scurvy is known to be caused by a nutritional deficiency, until the isolation of vitamin C and direct evidence of its link to scurvy in 1932, numerous theories and treatments were proposed, often on little or no experimental data.
This inconsistency is attributed to the lack of vitamin C as a distinct concept, an inability to reliably link different foods ( notably present in fresh citrus, watercress, and organ meat ) to scurvy.
An additional concept required to understand scurvy was the degradation of vitamin C by exposure to air and copper and other transition metal salts such as those of iron, thus changing the links of foods to scurvy over time.
Treatment by fresh food, particularly citrus fruit, was periodically implemented, as it had been since antiquity.
However until the 1930s, treatment was inconsistent, with many ineffective treatments used into the 20th century.
It was a Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind who first proved it could be treated with citrus fruit in experiments he described in his 1753 book, A Treatise of the Scurvy, though his advice was not implemented by the Royal Navy for several decades.
In infants, scurvy is sometimes referred to as Barlow 's disease, named after Sir Thomas Barlow, a British physician who described it.
However, Barlow 's disease may also refer to mitral valve prolapse.
Other eponyms for scurvy include Moeller 's disease and Cheadle 's disease.
Scurvy does not occur in most animals because they can synthesize their own vitamin C.
However, humans and other higher primates ( the simians - monkeys and apes - and tarsiers ), guinea pigs, most or all bats, and some species of birds and fish lack an enzyme ( L-gulonolactone oxidase ) necessary for such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet.
Vitamin C is widespread in plant tissues, with particularly high concentrations occurring in citrus fruits ( oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits ), tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages, and green peppers.
Iron is a chemical element with the symbol Fe ( from ) and atomic number 26.
It is a metal in the first transition series.
It is the most common element ( by mass ) forming the planet Earth as a whole, forming much of Earth 's outer and inner core.
It is the fourth most common element in the Earth 's crust.
Iron 's very common presence in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production as a result of fusion in high-mass stars, where the production of nickel-56 ( which decays to the most common isotope of iron ) is the last nuclear fusion reaction that is exothermic.
This causes radioactive nickel to become the last element to be produced before collapse of a supernova leads to the explosive events that scatter this precursor radionuclide of iron abundantly into space.
Like other group 8 elements, iron exists in a wide range of oxidation states, −2 to +6, although +2 and +3 are the most common.
Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water.
Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust.
Unlike many other metals which form passivating oxide layers, iron oxides occupy more volume than iron metal, and thus iron oxides flake off and expose fresh surfaces for corrosion.
Iron metal has been used since ancient times, though copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used first in history.
Pure iron is soft ( softer than aluminium ), but is unobtainable by smelting.
The material is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities from the smelting process, such as carbon.
A certain proportion of carbon ( between 0.002 % and 2.1 % ) produces steel, which may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron.
Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content.
Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel.
Steels and low carbon iron alloys with other metals ( alloy steels ) are by far the most common metals in industrial use, due to their great range of desirable properties and the abundance of iron.
Iron chemical compounds, which include ferrous and ferric compounds, have many uses.
Iron oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be ignited to create a thermite reaction, used in welding and purifying ores.
It forms binary compounds with the halogens and the chalcogens.
Among its organometallic compounds is ferrocene, the first sandwich compound discovered.
Iron plays an important role in biology, forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin ; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates.
Iron is also the metal used at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.
The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association ( BCBSA ) is a federation of 38 separate health insurance organizations and companies in the United States.
Combined, they directly or indirectly provide health insurance to over 99 million Americans.
The history of Blue Cross dates back to 1929, while the history of Blue Shield dates to 1939.
The Blue Cross Association dates back to 1960, while its Blue Shield counterpart was created in 1948.
The two organizations merged in 1982, forming the current association.
A potato chip ( known as a chip in American, Australian, New Zealand, Canadian, Singaporean, Hong Kong, South African and Jamaican English ; as a crisp in British English and Hiberno-English, and as either a chip or wafer in Indian English ) is a thin slice of potato that is deep fried or baked until crunchy.
Potato chips are commonly served as an appetizer, side dish, or snack.
The basic chips are cooked and salted ; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including seasonings, herbs, spices, cheeses, and artificial additives.
`` Crisps '', however, may also refer to many different types of savory snack products sold in the United Kingdom and Ireland, some made from potato, but may also be made from maize, tapioca or other cereals.
An example of these kinds of savory snacks is Monster Munch.
Potato chips are a predominant part of the snack food market in English-speaking countries and numerous other Western nations.
The global potato chip market generated total revenues of US $ 16.4 billion in 2005.
This accounted for 35.5 % of the total savory snacks market in that year ( US $ 46.1 billion ).
Henry Clay, Sr. ( April 12, 1777 – June 29, 1852 ) was a lawyer, politician and skilled orator who represented Kentucky in both the Senate and in the House of Representatives.
He served three different terms as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and was also Secretary of State from 1825 to 1829.
He lost his campaigns for president in 1824, 1832 and 1844.
Clay was a dominant figure in both the First and Second Party systems.
As a leading war hawk in 1812, he favored war with Britain and played a significant role in leading the nation to war in the War of 1812.
In 1824 he ran for president and lost, but threw his electoral votes to John Quincy Adams, who made him secretary of state as the Jacksonians denounced what they considered a `` corrupt bargain. ''
He ran and lost again in 1832 and 1844 as the candidate of the Whig Party, which he founded and usually dominated.
Clay was the foremost proponent of the American System, fighting for an increase in tariffs to foster industry in the United States, the use of federal funding to build and maintain infrastructure, and a strong national bank.
He opposed the annexation of Texas, fearing it would inject the slavery issue into politics.
Clay also opposed the Mexican-American War and the `` Manifest Destiny `` policy of Democrats, which cost him votes in the close 1844 election.
Dubbed the `` Great Pacificator, '' Clay brokered important compromises during the Nullification Crisis and on the slavery issue.
As part of the `` Great Triumvirate `` or `` Immortal Trio, '' along with his colleagues Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun, he was instrumental in formulating the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the Compromise of 1850.
He was viewed as the primary representative of Western interests in this group, and was given the names `` Henry of the West '' and `` The Western Star. ''
A plantation owner, Clay held slaves during his lifetime but freed them in his Will.
Abraham Lincoln, the Whig leader in Illinois, was a great admirer of Clay, saying he was `` my ideal of a great man. ''
Lincoln wholeheartedly supported Clay 's economic programs.
In 1957, a Senate Committee selected Clay as one of the five greatest U.S. Senators, along with Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Robert La Follette, and Robert Taft.
BJ 's Wholesale Club, Inc., commonly referred to simply as BJ 's, is a membership-only warehouse club chain operating on the United States East Coast, as well as in the state of Ohio.
The company is ranked # 232 on Fortune magazine 's 2010 listing of America 's 500 largest public corporations.
The Wizard of Oz, known during his reign as The Great and Powerful Oz, is the epithet of Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkel Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs, a fictional character in the Land of Oz, created by American author L. Frank Baum.
The character was further popularized by the classic 1939 movie, wherein his full name is not mentioned.

Marvin Gaye ( April 2, 1939April 1, 1984 ), born Marvin Pentz Gay, Jr., was an American singer-songwriter and musician.
Gaye helped to shape the sound of Motown Records in the 1960s with a string of hits including `` How Sweet It Is ( To Be Loved By You ) `` and `` I Heard It Through the Grapevine `` and duet recordings with Mary Wells and Tammi Terrell, later earning the titles `` Prince of Motown '' and `` Prince of Soul ''.
During the 1970s, Gaye recorded the concept albums What 's Going On and Let 's Get It On and became among the first artists in Motown to break away from the reins of its production company.
Gaye 's later recordings influenced several R & B subgenres such as quiet storm and neo-soul.
Following a period in Europe under a tax exile in the early 1980s, Gaye released the 1982 Grammy Award-winning hit `` Sexual Healing `` and the Midnight Love album.
Since his death in 1984, Gaye has been posthumously honored by many institutions, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The Chernobyl disaster (, Chornobylska Katastrofa – Chornobyl Catastrophe ) was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine ( then officially the Ukrainian SSR ), which was under the direct jurisdiction of the central authorities of the Soviet Union.
An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, which spread over much of the western USSR and Europe.
The Chernobyl disaster is widely considered to have been the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale ( the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 ).
The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles.
The official Soviet casualty count of 31 deaths has been disputed, and long-term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for.

Saddle Creek Records is an American record label based in Omaha, Nebraska.
Started as a college class project on entrepreneurship, the label was founded by Mike Mogis and Justin Oberst in 1993 ( as Lumberjack Records ).
Mogis soon turned over his role in the company to Robb Nansel.
The label is named after Saddle Creek Road, a street that cuts through the east side of midtown Omaha, and the beginnings of a scene whose members included Conor Oberst ( then a solo artist, currently of Bright Eyes, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, Desaparecidos and Monsters of Folk ), Tim Kasher ( then of Slowdown Virginia, currently of Cursive and The Good Life ), and others.
Collectively, they were known unofficially as the `` Creekers ''.
Saddle Creek first appeared in print on a show flyer, offering to `` Spend an evening with Saddle Creek '' ( later to be the title of the label 's DVD. )
Saddle Creek became an incorporated entity as a result of a class project on entrepreneurship.
Distribution is handled by the Alternative Distribution Alliance, which is under the Warner Music Group umbrella.
Saddle Creek Records continues to be the flagship label of a style of music called `` The Omaha Sound ``, characterized by a slight country twang.
This is increasingly inaccurate, though, with the rise of more electronic sounds such as those favored by The Faint and Broken Spindles.
The eclectic sounds of Saddle Creek 's disparate member bands is somewhat explained by their history ; a number of the original members of the label attended grade school together.
A `` sister label '', of sorts, to Saddle Creek is Team Love, started by Conor Oberst in 2004.
The label opened arms to their first bands not based in Omaha in 2001 with releases by Now It 's Overhead and Sorry About Dresden.
Other non-Nebraskan artists followed, including Los Angeles 's Rilo Kiley, Eric Bachmann ( formerly leader of Archers of Loaf and Crooked Fingers from North Carolina ), Georgie James ( Washington D.C. ), Two Gallants ( San Francisco ), and most recently Tokyo Police Club ( Toronto ).
In 2005, Spend an Evening with Saddle Creek, a documentary detailing the first ten years of the record label 's history, was released.
The DVD features extensive interviews with the Saddle Creek bands, archival footage, and rare live performances.
On June 8, 2007, the label opened their own music venue named Slowdown ( after the group Slowdown Virginia ), located in downtown Omaha, Nebraska.
The following is a list of episodes for the television show Full House.
In total, there were 192 episodes filmed for the show over the course of its eight seasons, from 1987 to 1995.
Full House is a situation comedy which chronicles a widowed father 's struggles of raising his three young daughters and the lives that they have touched.
The patriarch of the family, Danny ( Bob Saget ), invites his brother-in-law Jesse ( John Stamos ) and his best friend Joey ( Dave Coulier ), to help raise his children ( Candace Cameron, Jodie Sweetin, and Mary Kate/Ashley Olsen ), after his wife was killed during an automobile accident involving a drunk driver.
After episodes 88 and 89, Jesse marries Becky ( Lori Loughlin ), and they move into the attic.
Then, after episodes 104 and 105, Becky and Jesse have twin boys named Nicky and Alex ( Daniel and Kevin Renteria/Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit ).
The series ends with episode 192, `` Michelle Rides Again Part 2 '', when Michelle loses her memory and the family tries to restore it.
Notice of Stamp Act of 1765 in Newspaper
American newspapers reacted to the Stamp Act with anger and predictions of the demise of journalism.
The Stamp Act 1765 ( short title Duties in American Colonies Act 1765 ; 5 George III, c. 12 ) imposed a direct tax by the British Parliament specifically on the colonies of British America, and it required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp.
These printed materials were legal documents, magazines, newspapers and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies.
Like previous taxes, the stamp tax had to be paid in valid British currency, not in colonial paper money.
The purpose of the tax was to help pay for troops stationed in North America after the British victory in the Seven Years ' War.
The British government felt that the colonies were the primary beneficiaries of this military presence, and should pay at least a portion of the expense.
The Stamp Act met great resistance in the colonies.
The colonies sent no representatives to Parliament, and therefore had no influence over what taxes were raised, how they were levied, or how they would be spent.
Many colonists considered it a violation of their rights as Englishmen to be taxed without their consent —consent that only the colonial legislatures could grant.
Colonial assemblies sent petitions and protests.
The Stamp Act Congress held in New York City, reflecting the first significant joint colonial response to any British measure, also petitioned Parliament and the King.
Local protest groups, led by colonial merchants and landowners, established connections through correspondence that created a loose coalition that extended from New England to Georgia.
Protests and demonstrations initiated by the Sons of Liberty often turned violent and destructive as the masses became involved.
Very soon all stamp tax distributors were intimidated into resigning their commissions, and the tax was never effectively collected.
Opposition to the Stamp Act was not limited to the colonies.
British merchants and manufacturers, whose exports to the colonies were threatened by colonial economic problems exacerbated by the tax, also pressured Parliament.
The Act was repealed on March 18, 1766 as a matter of expedience, but Parliament affirmed its power to legislate for the colonies “in all cases whatsoever” by also passing the Declaratory Act.
There followed a series of new taxes and regulations, likewise opposed by the colonists.
The episode played a major role in defining the grievances and enabling the organized colonial resistance that led to the American Revolution in 1775.
PT-105 underway.
PT boats were a variety of torpedo-armed fast attack craft used by the United States Navy in World War II to attack larger surface ships.
`` PT '' is the US hull classification symbol for `` Patrol Torpedo ''.
The PT boat squadrons were nicknamed `` the mosquito fleet ''.
The Japanese called them `` Devil Boats ''.
The original pre– World War I torpedo boats were designed with `` displacement '' hulls.
They displaced up to 300 tons and the top speed was.
The PT boats used in World War II were built using the planing -type hull form developed for racing boats.
They were much smaller ( 30–75 tons ) and faster ( 35–40 knots ).
Both types were designed to strike at larger warships with torpedoes, using relatively high speed to get close, and small size to avoid being spotted and hit by gunfire.
They were much less expensive than large warships.
PT boats were much faster, smaller, and cheaper than conventional ( displacement hull ) vessels.
During World War II, American PT boats engaged enemy destroyers and numerous other surface craft, ranging from small boats to large supply ships.
PT boats also operated as gunboats against enemy small craft, such as armored barges used by the Japanese forces for inter-island transport.
Good Friday is a religious holiday observed primarily by Christians commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary.
The holiday is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, and may coincide with the Jewish observance of Passover.
It is also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Black Friday, or Easter Friday, though the latter properly refers to the Friday in Easter week.
Based on the details of the Canonical gospels, the Crucifixion of Jesus was most likely to have been on a Friday ( the day before the Sabbath ) ( ).
The estimated year of the Crucifixion is AD 33, by two different groups, and originally as AD 34 by Isaac Newton via the differences between the Biblical and Julian calendars and the crescent of the moon.
A third method, using a completely different astronomical approach based on a lunar Crucifixion darkness and eclipse model ( consistent with Apostle Peter 's reference to a `` moon of blood '' in Acts 2:20 ), points to Friday, 3 April AD 33.
The Great Basin is the largest area of endorheic watersheds in North America.
It is noted for both its arid conditions and its Basin and range topography that varies from the North American low point at Badwater Basin to the highest point of the contiguous United States, less than away at the summit of Mount Whitney.
The region spans several physiographic divisions, biomes / ecoregions, and deserts.

Beowulf ( ; Old English : ) is a legendary Geatish hero and later turned king in the epic poem named after him, one of the oldest surviving pieces of literature in the English language.
The attack on Pearl Harbor ( called Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters ( Operation Z in planning ) and the Battle of Pearl Harbor ) was a surprise military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on the morning of December 7, 1941 ( December 8 in Japan ).
From the standpoint of the defenders, the attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time.
The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States.
The base was attacked by 353 Japanese fighters, bombers and torpedo planes in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers.
All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four being sunk.
Two of these were later raised, and with the remaining four repaired, six battleships returned to service later in the war.
The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer.
188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed ; 2,402 Americans were killed and 1,282 wounded.
Important base installations such as the power station, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building ( also home of the intelligence section ) were not attacked.
Japanese losses were light : 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 65 servicemen killed or wounded.
One Japanese sailor was captured.
The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters.
The following day ( December 8 ), the United States declared war on Japan.
Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been strong, disappeared.
Clandestine support of Britain ( for example the Neutrality Patrol ) was replaced by active alliance.
Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day.
There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan.
However, the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, `` a date which will live in infamy ``.
U.S. Route 85 ( US 85 ) is a north–south United States highway that runs for in the Mountain - Northern Plains states of the United States.
The southern terminus of the route is at the United States-Mexico border in El Paso, Texas, connecting with Mexican Federal Highway 45.
The northern terminus is at the United States-Canada border in Fortuna, North Dakota, where the route continues north as Saskatchewan Highway 35.
In both the United States and Saskatchewan, Canada the route is known as the CanAm Highway.
Sections of US 85 are considered part of the Theodore Roosevelt Expressway.
The United States presidential election of 1968 was the 46th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 5, 1968.
The Republican nominee, former Vice-President Richard Nixon, won the election over the Democratic nominee, incumbent Vice-President Hubert Humphrey.
Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore law and order to the nation 's cities, torn by riots and crime.
Analysts have argued the election of 1968 is a realigning election as it permanently disrupted the New Deal Coalition that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years.
Coming four years after Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson won in a historic landslide, the election saw the incumbent president forced out of the race and a Republican elected for the first time in twelve years.
It was a wrenching national experience, conducted during a year of violence that included the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., and subsequent race riots across the nation, the assasination of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses, and violent confrontations between police and anti-war protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic party split again and again.
The election featured the strongest third party effort since 1912 by former Alabama Governor George Wallace, a Democrat.
Because Wallace 's campaign opposed federal intervention in the South to end school segregation, he carried the Deep South and ran well in ethnic industrial districts in the North.
This was the last election in which New York had the most votes in the electoral college ( 43 votes ).
After the 1970 census, California gained the most electoral votes and has remained the most populous state since then.
This is the latest election where a presidential ticket won without carrying the vice presidential candidate 's home state.
Windows Task Manager is a task manager or System monitor application included with the Microsoft Windows NT family of operating systems that provides limited information about computer performance and running applications, processes and CPU usage, commit charge and memory information, network activity and statistics, logged-in users, and system services ( and as often is the case with software tools provided by Microsoft for Windows, 3rd party software is available which fills the requirements more thoroughly, e.g, `` Process Explorer '', `` Extended Task Manager '', `` Anvir Task Manager '', `` Process Hacker '', and `` System Explorer '' ).
The Task Manager can also be used to set process priorities, processor affinity, forcibly terminate processes, and shut down, restart, hibernate or log off from Windows.
Windows Task Manager was introduced with Windows NT 4.0.
Previous versions of Windows NT included the Task List application, which had far fewer features.
The task list was capable of listing currently running processes and killing them, or creating a new process.
In Windows XP only, a Shutdown menu is also present that allows access to Standby, Hibernate, Turn off, Restart, Log Off and Switch User.
Earlier versions of Microsoft Windows ( Microsoft Windows 3.x, Windows 95, Windows 98 ) had a program known as tasks to display the programs currently running.
This file was executed by running the taskman.exe file from the C : \Windows directory.
Kanji ( ; ) are the adopted logographic Chinese characters ( hanzi ) that are used in the modern Japanese writing system along with hiragana ( ひらがな, ), katakana ( カタカナ, ), Hindu-Arabic numerals, and the occasional use of the Latin alphabet.
The Japanese term kanji ( ) for the Chinese characters literally means `` Han characters '' and is written using the same characters as the Chinese hanzi ( ).
John R Williams ( May 4, 1782 – October 20, 1854 ) was an American soldier, merchant, and politician who is most well known for serving as the first mayor of Detroit, Michigan.
In total, he served as Detroit 's mayor for five other terms.
He also was a brigadier general in the United States Army during the Black Hawk War.
A simple dry magnetic portable compass.
A smartphone that can be used as a compass because of the magnetometer inside.
An iPhone that can be used as a geological compass because of the 3-axis teslameter and 3-axis accelerometer inside it
A military compass that was used during World War I.
A compass is a navigational instrument that shows directions in a frame of reference that is stationary relative to the surface of the earth.
The frame of reference defines the four cardinal directions ( or points ) – north, south, east, and west.
Intermediate directions are also defined.
Usually, a diagram called a compass rose, which shows the directions ( with their names usually abbreviated to initials ), is marked on the compass.
When the compass is in use, the rose is aligned with the real directions in the frame of reference, so, for example, the `` N '' mark on the rose really points to the north.
Frequently, in addition to the rose or sometimes instead of it, angle markings in degrees are shown on the compass.
North corresponds to zero degrees, and the angles increase clockwise, so east is 90 degrees, south is 180, and west is 270.
These numbers allow the compass to show azimuths or bearings, which are commonly stated in this notation.
The magnetic compass was first invented as a device for divination as early as the Chinese Han Dynasty ( Since about 206 BC ).
The compass was used in Song Dynasty China by the military for navigational orienteering by 1040-1044, and was used for maritime navigation by 1111 to 1117.
The use of a compass is recorded in Western Europe between 1187 and 1202, and in Persia in 1232.
The dry compass was invented in Europe around 1300.
This was supplanted in the early 20th century by the liquid-filled magnetic compass.
The Inca Empire or Inka Empire ( Quechua : Tawantinsuyu ) was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America.
The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in Cusco in modern-day Peru.
The Inca civilization arose from the highlands of Peru sometime in the early 13th century.
From 1438 to 1533, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centered on the Andean mountain ranges, including, besides Peru, large parts of modern Ecuador, western and south central Bolivia, northwest Argentina, north and central Chile, and southern Colombia into a state comparable to the historical empires of Eurasia.
The official language of the empire was Quechua, although hundreds of local languages and dialects of Quechua were spoken.
The Inca referred to their empire as Tawantinsuyu which can be translated as The Four Regions or The Four United Provinces.
There were many local forms of worship, most of them concerning local sacred `` Huacas ``, but the Inca leadership encouraged the worship of Inti —the sun god—and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of Pachamama.
The Incas considered their King, the Sapa Inca, to be the `` child of the sun. ''
The kidneys are organs that serve several essential regulatory roles in most animals, including vertebrates and some invertebrates.
They are essential in the urinary system and also serve homeostatic functions such as the regulation of electrolytes, maintenance of acid–base balance, and regulation of blood pressure ( via maintaining salt and water balance ).
They serve the body as a natural filter of the blood, and remove wastes which are diverted to the urinary bladder.
In producing urine, the kidneys excrete wastes such as urea and ammonium, and they are also responsible for the reabsorption of water, glucose, and amino acids.
The kidneys also produce hormones including calcitriol, erythropoietin, and the enzyme renin.
Located at the rear of the abdominal cavity in the retroperitoneum, the kidneys receive blood from the paired renal arteries, and drain into the paired renal veins.
Each kidney excretes urine into a ureter, itself a paired structure that empties into the urinary bladder.
Renal physiology is the study of kidney function, while nephrology is the medical specialty concerned with kidney diseases.
Diseases of the kidney are diverse, but individuals with kidney disease frequently display characteristic clinical features.
Common clinical conditions involving the kidney include the nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, renal cysts, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis, and urinary tract obstruction.
Various cancers of the kidney exist ; the most common adult renal cancer is renal cell carcinoma.
Cancers, cysts, and some other renal conditions can be managed with removal of the kidney, or nephrectomy.
When renal function, measured by glomerular filtration rate, is persistently poor, dialysis and kidney transplantation may be treatment options.
Although they are not severely harmful, kidney stones can be painful and a nuisance.
The removal of kidney stones involves ultrasound treatment to break up the stones into smaller pieces, which are then passed through the urinary tract.
One common symptom of kidney stones is a sharp pain in the medial/lateral segments of the lower back.

White chocolate is a chocolate derivative.
It commonly consists of cocoa butter, sugar, milk solids and salt, and is characterized by a pale yellow or ivory appearance.
The melting point of cocoa butter, its primary cocoa bean component, is high enough to keep white chocolate solid at room temperature.
Donald Leon `` Don '' Blankenship ( born March 14, 1950 ) was Chairman and CEO of Massey Energy Co., the sixth largest coal company ( by 2008 production ) in the United States.

Negligence ( Lat. negligentia, from neglegere, to neglect, literally `` not to pick up something '' ) is a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances.
The area of tort law known as negligence involves harm caused by carelessness, not intentional harm.
According to Jay M. Feinman of the Rutgers University School of Law ;
`` The core idea of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care when they act by taking account of the potential harm that they might foreseeably cause harm to other people. ''
`` those who go personally or bring property where they know that they or it may come into collision with the persons or property of others have by law a duty cast upon them to use reasonable care and skill to avoid such a collision. ''
Fletcher v Rylands ( [ 1866 ] LR 1 Ex 265 )
Through civil litigation, if an injured person proves that another person acted negligently to cause their injury, they can recover damages to compensate for their harm.
Proving a case for negligence can potentially entitle the injured plaintiff to compensation for harm to their body, property, mental well-being, financial status, or intimate relationships.
However, because negligence cases are very fact-specific, this general definition does not fully explain the concept of when the law will require one person to compensate another for losses caused by accidental injury.
Further, the law of negligence at common law is only one aspect of the law of liability.
Although resulting damages must be proven in order to recover compensation in a negligence action, the nature and extent of those damages are not the primary focus of negligence cases.
A melanocytic nevus ( also known as `` Nevocytic nevus '' ) is a type of lesion that contains nevus cells ( a type of melanocyte ).
Some sources equate the term mole with `` melanocytic nevus ''.
Other sources reserve the term `` mole '' for other purposes.
The majority of moles appear during the first two decades of a person’s life, while about one in every 100 babies is born with moles.
Acquired moles are a form of benign neoplasm, while congenital moles, or congenital nevi, are considered a minor malformation or hamartoma and may be at a higher risk for melanoma.
A mole can be either subdermal ( under the skin ) or a pigmented growth on the skin, formed mostly of a type of cell known as a melanocyte.
The high concentration of the body’s pigmenting agent, melanin, is responsible for their dark color.
Moles are a member of the family of skin lesions known as nevi.
The comprehensive metabolic panel, or chemical screen, ( CMP ; CPT code 80053 ) is a panel of 14 blood tests which serves as an initial broad medical screening tool.
The CMP provides a rough check of kidney function, liver function, and electrolyte and fluid balance, but it is far from perfect.
Abnormal values from a CBC may be a result of false positives and thus the CBC may need to be repeated for a patient ( or replaced with a more specific test ).
The CMP is an expanded version of the basic metabolic panel ( BMP ), which does not include liver tests.
A CMP ( or BMP ) can be ordered as part of a routine physical examination, or may be used to monitor a patient with a chronic disease, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
Previous names for the panel of tests have been Chem 12, Chemistry panel, Chemistry screen, SMA 12, SMA 20 and SMAC ( Sequential Multiple Analysis - Computer ).
The tests are performed on machines based on the AutoAnalyzer invented in 1957.
Natural gas extraction by countries in cubic meters per year.
Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen sulfide.
Natural gas is an energy source often used for heating, cooking, and electricity generation.
It is also used as fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals.
Natural gas is found in deep underground natural rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates.
Petroleum is also another resource found in proximity to and with natural gas.
Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms : biogenic and thermogenic.
Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes, bogs, landfills, and shallow sediments.
Deeper in the earth, at greater temperature and pressure, thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material.
Before natural gas can be used as a fuel, it must undergo processing to remove impurities, including water, to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas.
The by-products of processing include ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide ( which may be converted into pure sulfur ), carbon dioxide, water vapor, and sometimes helium and nitrogen.
Natural gas is often informally referred to simply as gas, especially when compared to other energy sources such as oil or coal.
This page is about the Imagination Movers band.
For information about the TV show starring the band, see Imagination Movers ( TV series ).
Imagination Movers is a band formed in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2003.
The lineup includes Rich Collins, Scott Durbin, Dave Poche, and Scott `` Smitty '' Smith.
Members of the group were longtime friends and neighbors.
The group started as a television/music concept which was pitched to local PBS affiliates in New Orleans.
WLAE-TV was the first to take an interest in the group and later introduced them to Beth Courtney, the President & Chief Executive Officer at Louisiana Public Broadcasting.
Soon after, LPB began airing one-minute videos produced by the Imagination Movers themselves.
The Movers built a sizable regional following by setting educational songs for kids to melodies and rhythms that adults appreciate as well.
They sold more than 100,000 copies of their self-produced CDs and DVDs.
Their three indie CDs : `` Good Ideas, '' `` Calling All Movers, '' and `` Eight Feet '' along with their grass roots DVD `` Stir It Up '' have, combined, won fourteen national awards, from such groups as the National Association of Parenting Publications ( NAPPA ) and Parents ' Choice.
In early 2005, Disney took notice, and initiated negotiations to add the Movers to the company 's roster.
These were interrupted in August when the flood protection designed and built by the Army Corps of Engineers to protect New Orleans failed.
The resulting floodwater claimed the band 's office, as well as the homes of Collins, Durbin and Poche – but the deal was signed in the spring of 2006.
In 2008, Walt Disney Records introduced the Imagination Movers ' music to the nation with the release of the Movers ' first nationally-released CD, `` Juice Box Heroes. ''
In September 2008, a 30-minute show featuring the group began airing on the Disney Channel 's preschool programming block known as Playhouse Disney, and currently airs on Playhouse Disney 's replacement, Disney Junior.
The Movers write and perform all the songs on their show.
Moreover, the Imagination Movers have received critical kudos for their live concert performances.
In October 2009, the Imagination Movers started the `` Live from the Idea Warehouse Concert Tour 2009 ''.
Traveling from mid-October to mid-December 2009 their live performances include lots of their favorite songs and dancing, as well as video appearances of Warehouse Mouse.
Beginning in early-February 2011 and wrapping up in late May 2011, the Imagination Movers presented their `` In a Big Warehouse Concert Tour, '' playing more than 100 shows in 50+ cities across North America.
From March to October 2012, the Imagination Movers toured North America on their post-Disney `` Rock-O-Matic '' tour.
The show maintained several elements of the original TV concept, such as an on-stage `` idea emergency '' and several sets from their older catalogue ; however, with the departure of Wendy Calio back to her native Hawaii, the character `` Nina '', along with her musical numbers, is not present.
The tour promotes the Imagination Movers ' new album/DVD release, `` Rock-O-Matic '', which features all new music from the band.
The album itself is produced independently of Disney and has a notably more mature, contemporary rock-and-roll sound, though still very appropriate for children.
Several performance dates were moved to later in 2012 to benefit from the increased exposure of the Imagination Movers TV show now playing daily on Disney Junior.
The platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ) is a semiaquatic mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania.
Together with the four species of echidna, it is one of the five extant species of monotremes, the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth.
It is the sole living representative of its family ( Ornithorhynchidae ) and genus ( Ornithorhynchus ), though a number of related species have been found in the fossil record.
The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, duck -billed, beaver -tailed, otter -footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it, with some considering it an elaborate fraud.
It is one of the few venomous mammals, the male platypus having a spur on the hind foot that delivers a venom capable of causing severe pain to humans.
The unique features of the platypus make it an important subject in the study of evolutionary biology and a recognisable and iconic symbol of Australia ; it has appeared as a mascot at national events and is featured on the reverse of its 20-cent coin.
The platypus is the animal emblem of the state of New South Wales.
Until the early 20th century, it was hunted for its fur, but it is now protected throughout its range.
Although captive breeding programmes have had only limited success and the platypus is vulnerable to the effects of pollution, it is not under any immediate threat.
The Chupacabra or Chupacabras (, from chupar `` to suck '' and cabra `` goat '', literally `` goat sucker '' ) is a legendary cryptid rumored to inhabit parts of the Americas.
It is associated more recently with sightings of an allegedly unknown animal in Puerto Rico ( where these sightings were first reported ), Mexico, and the United States, especially in the latter 's Latin American communities.
The name comes from the animal 's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, especially goats.
Physical descriptions of the creature vary.
Eyewitness sightings have been claimed as early as 1995 in Puerto Rico, and have since been reported as far north as Maine, and as far south as Chile, and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like Russia and The Philippines.
It is supposedly a heavy creature, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail.
Sighting reports of the Chupacabra have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence, while most reports in northern Mexico and the southern United States have been verified as canids afflicted by mange.
Biologists and wildlife management officials view the chupacabra as a contemporary legend.
The North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) is an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America.
The agreement came into force on January 1, 1994.
It superseded the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico
NAFTA has two supplements : the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation ( NAAEC ) and the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation ( NAALC ).
Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation ( ANSI / ASHRAE Standard 55 ).
Maintaining this standard of thermal comfort for occupants of buildings or other enclosures is one of the important goals of HVAC ( heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ) design engineers.
The Predicted Mean Vote ( PMV ) model stands among the most recognized thermal comfort models.
It was developed using principles of heat balance and experimental data collected in a controlled climate chamber under steady state conditions.
Because the PMV model was derived from data collected in a controlled climate, it is not suitable for applications in naturally ventilated spaces which often have high levels of air movement.
This shortcoming motivated the development of a family of empirical statistical models of thermal comfort in naturally ventilated spaces known as adaptive models.
Adaptive models of thermal comfort consider occupants as dynamically interacting with their environment, and controlling their thermal comfort by means of clothing or window-opening and closing.
This is in contrast to thermal comfort in sealed buildings, in which occupants experience the environment passively.
Thermal comfort is affected by heat conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporative heat loss.
Thermal comfort is maintained when the heat generated by human metabolism is allowed to dissipate, thus maintaining thermal equilibrium with the surroundings.
It has been long recognized that the sensation of feeling hot or cold is not just dependent on air temperature alone.
Thermal comfort calculations according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 can be freely performed with the CBE Thermal Comfort Tool for ASHRAE-55.
Durante degli Alighieri, simply referred to as Dante (, ; ; c. 1265–1321 ), was a major Italian poet of the Middle Ages.
His Divine Comedy, originally called ' and later called ' by Boccaccio, is widely considered the greatest literary work composed in the Italian language and a masterpiece of world literature.
In Italy he is known as ' ( `` the Supreme Poet '' ) or just '.
He, Petrarch and Boccaccio are also known as `` the three fountains '' or `` the three crowns ''.
Dante is also called the `` Father of the Italian language ''.
Headquarters ( Kobe, Japan )
( ) is a tire and rubber company based in Japan.
It is part of the Sumitomo Group.
The company traces its origins to 1909, when the Sumitomo Group made an investment in Dunlop Japan, the newly formed Japanese subsidiary of the British company Dunlop Rubber.
Over the years Sumitomo and Dunlop developed a close business relationship, and in 1963 the Sumitomo Group acquired control of Dunlop Japan and renamed it Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd.
In 1985, when Dunlop Rubber was taken over by BTR plc, the company acquired the automobile tire assets of Dunlop, including the right to use the Dunlop brand on automobile tires.
The acquisition did not include the US and Australian businesses, which were separately owned, but in 1986 Sumitomo also acquired the Dunlop Tire Corporation of the US from its management.
In 1997, Sumitomo formed a joint venture with Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, by which Goodyear and Sumitomo agreed to manufacture tires for each other 's markets, including Dunlop branded tires.
As part of the agreement, Goodyear acquired 75 % interests in Dunlop Tyres, the UK company which Sumitomo had formed, and in Dunlop Tire Corporation.
Goodyear and Sumitomo also made investments in each other.
Today, the company makes a wide range of rubber based products, including automobile tires, golf balls and tennis balls.

The Alps are one of the great mountain range systems of Europe stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries from Austria and Slovenia in the east, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, France to the west and Italy and Monaco to the south.
The mountains were formed over hundreds of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided.
Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn.
Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps.
The Alpine region area contains many peaks higher than, known as the `` four-thousanders ``.
The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe ; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones.
Wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of, and plants such as Edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations.
Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the Paleolithic era.
A mummified man, determined to be 5,000 years old, was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian–Italian border in 1991.
By the 6th century BC, the Celtic La Tène culture was well established.
Hannibal may have crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants, and the Romans had settlements in the region.
In 1800 Napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000.
The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists, writers, and artists, in particular the Romantics, followed by the golden age of alpinism as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks.
In World War II the Third Reich invaded the Alpine countries, with the exception of Switzerland and Liechtenstein ; Adolf Hitler kept a base of operation in the Bavarian Alps throughout the war.
The Alpine region has a strong cultural identity.
The traditional culture of farming, cheesemaking, and woodworking still exists in Alpine villages, although the tourist industry began to grow early in the 20th century and expanded greatly after World War II to become the dominant industry by the end of the century.
The Winter Olympic Games have been hosted in the Swiss, French, Italian, Austrian and German Alps.
At present the region is home to 14 million people and has 120 million annual visitors.
Lois Patrice Griffin ( née Pewterschmidt ) is a character from the animated television series Family Guy.
She is voiced by writer Alex Borstein and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the family in the 15-minute short on December 20, 1998.
Lois was created and designed by series creator Seth MacFarlane.
MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company based on Larry and Steve, a short made by MacFarlane which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve.
After the pilot was given the green light, the Griffin family appeared on the episode `` Death Has a Shadow ``.
Lois is the mother of the Griffin family.
With her husband Peter, she has had three children : Meg, Chris, and Stewie.
Lois is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother, despite her admitting to being a drug user, a recovering meth addict kleptomaniac.
Lois has also had several affairs, one of which allegedly resulted in the conception of Meg.
She has appeared in other media relating to Family Guy—including a video game, commercials and books—and inspired an entire line of merchandise.
Lois 's distinctive New York accent originated from a character in a stage show that Alex Borstein had performed in, which was largely inspired by a relative who grew up on Long Island, New York.
Family transmission of Basque language ( Basque as initial language )
Percentage of students registered in Basque language schools ( 2000–2005 ).
Location of the Basque-language provinces within Spain and France
Basque ( endonym :, ) is the ancestral language of the Basque people, who inhabit the Basque Country, a region spanning an area in northeastern Spain and southwestern France.
It is spoken by 27 % of Basques in all territories ( 714,136 out of 2,648,998 ).
Of these, 663,035 live in the Spanish part of the Basque country and the remaining 51,100 live in the French part.
In academic discussions of the distribution of Basque in Spain and France, it is customary to refer to three ancient provinces in France and four Spanish provinces.
Native speakers are concentrated in a contiguous area including parts of the Spanish autonomous communities of the Basque Country and Navarre and in the western half of the French département of Pyrénées-Atlantiques.
The Basque Autonomous Community is an administrative entity within the binational ethnographic Basque Country incorporating the traditional Spanish provinces of Biscay, Gipuzkoa, and Álava, which retain their existence as politico-administrative divisions.
These provinces and many areas of Navarre are heavily populated by ethnic Basques, but Basque was, at least until the 1990s, not spoken as a native language in most of Álava, western parts of Biscay and central and southern areas of Navarre, either because it had been replaced by Spanish along the centuries, in some areas, or because it had never been spoken there, in other areas.
In southwestern France, the ancient Basque-populated provinces were Labourd, Lower Navarre, and Soule.
They and other regions were consolidated into a single département in 1790 under the name Basses-Pyrénées, a name which persisted until 1970.
A standardized form of the Basque language, called Euskara Batua, was developed by the Basque Language Academy in the late 1960s.
Euskara Batua was created so that Basque language could be used—and easily understood by all Basque speakers—in formal situations ( education, mass media, literature ), and this is its main use today.
The role of this standard Basque language depends on the linguistic educational model of each region and each school.
In most areas of the Spanish Basque Country, the educational Model D, where all subjects are taught in Basque, except `` Spanish language and literature '' ( which is taught in Spanish ) is now the predominant model.
In France, the Basque language school Seaska and the association for a bilingual ( Basque and French ) schooling Ikasbi meet a wide range of Basque language educational needs up to the Sixth Form, while often struggling to surmount financial and administrative constraints.
Apart from this standardized version, there are five main Basque dialects : Bizkaian, Gipuzkoan, and Upper Navarrese in Spain, and Navarrese–Lapurdian and Zuberoan ( in France ).
Although they take their names from the mentioned historic provinces, the dialect boundaries are not congruent with province boundaries.
The President, Directors and Company, of the Bank of the United States, commonly known as the First Bank of the United States, was a central bank, chartered for a term of twenty years, by the United States Congress on February 25, 1791.
Establishment of the Bank was included in a three-part expansion of federal fiscal and monetary power ( along with a federal mint and excise taxes ) championed by Alexander Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury.
Hamilton believed a central bank was necessary to stabilize and improve the nation 's credit, and to improve handling of the financial business of the United States government under the newly enacted Constitution.
Officially proposed to the first session of the First Congress in 1790, Hamilton 's Bank faced widespread resistance from opponents of increased federal power.
Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and James Madison led the opposition, which claimed that the bank was unconstitutional, and that it benefited merchants and investors at the expense of the majority of the population.
The First Bank building is now a National Historic Landmark located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania within Independence National Historical Park.
James Wesley Marsters ( born August 20, 1962 ) is an American actor and musician.
Marsters first came to the attention of the general public playing the popular character Spike, a platinum-blond yobbish English vampire in the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spin-off series, Angel, from 1997 to 2004.
Since then, he has gone on to play other science fiction roles, such as the alien supervillain Brainiac on the Superman -inspired series Smallville, the omnisexual time traveller Captain John Hart in British science-fiction show Torchwood and terrorist Barnabas Greeley in Sci fi 's Caprica.
Marsters appeared in a supporting role in the 2007 movie P.S.
I Love You and as the main antagonist, Piccolo, in the 2009 fantasy adventure film Dragonball Evolution.
He appeared as a recurring character in the first season of the revival of Hawaii 5-0.
In molecular biology, human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) is a hormone produced by the fertilized egg after conception.
Later during pregnancy it is made by the developing placenta, and later by the placental component syncytiotrophoblast.
Some cancerous tumors produce this hormone ; therefore, elevated levels measured when the patient is not pregnant can lead to a cancer diagnosis.
However, it is not known whether this production is a contributing cause or an effect of tumorigenesis.
The pituitary analogue of hCG, known as luteinizing hormone ( LH ), is produced in the pituitary gland of males and females of all ages.
, the FDA has prohibited the sale of `` homeopathic '' and over the counter hCG diet products and declared them fraudulent and illegal.
Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, known by her stage name Beyoncé ( ; born September 4, 1981 ), is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress.
Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in singing and dancing competitions as a child before forming in 1990 a group with Kelly Rowland and LaTavia Roberson that was eventually named Destiny 's Child.
Once signed to Columbia Records, the girls subsequently became one of the world 's best-selling girl groups of all time.
The group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil and Knowles suffered from depression that lasted for a number of years.
During the group 's hiatus, Knowles released her debut solo album Dangerously in Love ( 2003 ), which earned her five Grammy Awards and has sold a total of 4.9 million copies in the US alone.
It spawned Billboard number one singles `` Crazy in Love, '' considered by VH1 to be the `` Greatest Song Of the 00 's, '' and `` Baby Boy. ''
Following the disbandment of Destiny 's Child in 2005, Knowles 's second solo album B'Day ( 2006 ) contained the top five singles `` Déjà Vu ``, `` Irreplaceable ``, and `` Beautiful Liar ``.
Her performance in Dreamgirls ( 2006 ) earned her two Golden Globe nominations.
Knowles ' work playing Etta James in that film inspired her subsequent album I Am...
Sasha Fierce ( 2008 ) which spawned hits `` If I Were a Boy ``, `` Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) ``, `` Halo ``, and `` Sweet Dreams ``.
The album also helped Knowles earn six Grammys in 2010, breaking the record for most Grammy Awards won by a female artist in one night.
Her fourth album 4 ( 2011 ) deviated towards traditional R & B and became her fourth consecutive number one album on the Billboard 200.
In January 2012, Knowles gave birth to daughter Blue Ivy Carter, her first child with husband Jay-Z.
Knowles has sold over 13 million albums in the US and 118 million records worldwide ( as well as a further 50 million records with Destiny 's Child ), and is one of the best-selling music artists of all time.
The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) recognized Knowles as the Top Certified Artist of the 2000s.
In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the decade and ranked her the Top Female Artist and the fourth Artist of the Decade.
Beyoncé Knowles is the most nominated woman in Grammy Award history, receiving 17 awards ; other accolades include 12 MTV Video Music Awards, 7 Billboard Awards including a Millennium Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as part of Destiny 's Child.
`` Angry All the Time '' is the title of a song written by Bruce Robison and first recorded on his 1998 album Wrapped.

First/given, middle, and last/family/surname diagram with J. S. Bach as example.
J. S. Bach shared his given name with six immediate family members and many extended family members.
He shared his family name with most family members.
A given name, in Western contexts often referred to as a first name, is a personal name that specifies and differentiates between members of a group of individuals, especially in a family, all of whose members usually share the same family name ( surname ).
A given name is purposefully given, usually by a child 's parents at or near birth, in contrast to an inherited one such as a family name.
A given name is sometimes legally changed through a name change.
Given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner in informal situations.
In more formal situations the surname is used instead, unless it is necessary to distinguish between people with the same surname.
The idiom `` on a first-name basis '' ( or `` on first-name terms '' ) alludes to the familiarity of addressing another by a given name.
The western style of having both a family name ( surname ) and a given name is far from universal.
In many countries it is common for ordinary people to have only one name ( a mononym ).
Hydrochloric acid is a clear, colourless solution of hydrogen chloride ( H Cl ) in water.
It is a highly corrosive, strong mineral acid with many industrial uses.
Hydrochloric acid is found naturally in gastric acid.
Historically called muriatic acid, and spirits of salt, hydrochloric acid was produced from vitriol ( sulfuric acid ) and common salt.
It first appeared during the Renaissance, and then it was used by chemists such as Glauber, Priestley and Davy in their scientific research.
With major production starting in the Industrial Revolution, hydrochloric acid is used in the chemical industry as a chemical reagent in the large-scale production of vinyl chloride for PVC plastic, and MDI / TDI for polyurethane.
It has numerous smaller-scale applications, including household cleaning, production of gelatin and other food additives, descaling, and leather processing.
About 20 million tonnes of hydrochloric acid are produced annually.
Wheat ( Triticum spp. ) is a cereal grain, originally from the Levant region of the Near East and Ethiopian Highlands, but now cultivated worldwide.
In 2010, world production of wheat was 651 million tons, making it the third most-produced cereal after maize ( 844 million tons ) and rice ( 672 million tons ).
Wheat was the second most-produced cereal in 2009 ; world production in that year was 682 million tons, after maize ( 817 million tons ), and with rice as a close third ( 679 million tons ).
This grain is grown on more land area than any other commercial food.
World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined.
Globally, wheat is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food, having a higher protein content than soybeans or the other major cereals, maize ( corn ) or rice.
In terms of total production tonnages used for food, it is currently second to rice as the main human food crop and ahead of maize, after allowing for maize 's more extensive use in animal feeds.
Wheat was a key factor enabling the emergence of city-based societies at the start of civilization because it was one of the first crops that could be easily cultivated on a large scale, and had the additional advantage of yielding a harvest that provides long-term storage of food.
Wheat contributed to the emergence of city-states in the Fertile Crescent, including the Babylonian and Assyrian empires.
Wheat grain is a staple food used to make flour for leavened, flat and steamed breads, biscuits, cookies, cakes, breakfast cereal, pasta, noodles, couscous and for fermentation to make beer, other alcoholic beverages, or biofuel.
Wheat is planted to a limited extent as a forage crop for livestock, and its straw can be used as a construction material for roofing thatch.
The whole grain can be milled to leave just the endosperm for white flour.
The by-products of this are bran and germ.
The whole grain is a concentrated source of vitamins, minerals, and protein, while the refined grain is mostly starch.

The Dharma wheel, often used to represent the Noble Eightfold Path
The Noble Eightfold Path (, ) is one of the principal teachings of the Buddha, who described it as the way leading to the cessation of suffering ( dukkha ) and the achievement of self-awakening.
It is used to develop insight into the true nature of phenomena ( or reality ) and to eradicate greed, hatred, and delusion.
The Noble Eightfold Path is the fourth of the Buddha 's Four Noble Truths ; the first element of the Noble Eightfold Path is, in turn, an understanding of the Four Noble Truths.
It is also known as the Middle Path or Middle Way.
All eight elements of the Path begin with the word `` right '', which translates the word samyañc ( in Sanskrit ) or sammā ( in Pāli ).
These denote completion, togetherness, and coherence, and can also suggest the senses of `` perfect '' or `` ideal ''.
'Samma ' is also translated as `` wholesome '', `` wise '' and `` skillful ''.
In Buddhist symbolism, the Noble Eightfold Path is often represented by means of the dharma wheel ( dharmachakra ), whose eight spokes represent the eight elements of the path.

Economics is the social science that analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.
The term economics comes from the Ancient Greek ( ', `` management of a household, administration '' ) from ( ', `` house '' ) + ( ', `` custom '' or `` law '' ), hence `` rules of the house ( hold ) ''.
Political economy was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested `` economics '' as a shorter term for `` economic science '' that also avoided a narrow political-interest connotation and as similar in form to `` mathematics ``, `` ethics '', and so forth.
A focus of the subject is how economic agents behave or interact and how economies work.
Consistent with this, a primary textbook distinction is between microeconomics and macroeconomics.
Microeconomics examines the behavior of basic elements in the economy, including individual agents ( such as households and firms or as buyers and sellers ) and markets, and their interactions.
Macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy and issues affecting it, including unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and monetary and fiscal policy.
Other broad distinctions include those between positive economics ( describing `` what is '' ) and normative economics ( advocating `` what ought to be '' ) ; between economic theory and applied economics ; between rational and behavioral economics ; and between mainstream economics ( more `` orthodox '' and dealing with the `` rationality-individualism-equilibrium nexus '' ) and heterodox economics ( more `` radical '' and dealing with the `` institutions-history-social structure nexus '' ).
Economic analysis may be applied throughout society, as in business, finance, health care, and government, but also to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, law, politics, religion, social institutions, war, and science.
At the turn of the 21st century, the expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism.
An increasing number of economists have called for increased emphasis on environmental sustainability ; this area of research is known as Ecological economics.

US county household median income 2009.
Median US household income, 2001-2011
Household income is a measure commonly used by the United States government and private institutions.
Each household is measured by the income of every resident over the age of 15.
Income includes wages and salaries, unemployment insurance, disability payments, child support payments received, regular rental receipts, as well as any personal business, investment, or other kinds of income received routinely.
While inflation-adjusted ( `` real '' ) household income had been increasing almost every year from 1945 to 1999, it has since been flat and even decreased recently.
U.S. median household income fell from $ 51,144 in 2010 to $ 50,502 in 2011.
Extreme poverty in the United States, meaning households living on less than $ 2 per day before government benefits, doubled from 1996 to 1.5 million households in 2011, including 2.8 million children.
The residents of the household do not have to be related to the head of the household for their earnings to be considered part of the household 's income.
As households tend to share a similar economic context, the use of household income remains among the most widely accepted measures of income.
That the size of a household is not commonly taken into account in such measures may distort any analysis of fluctuations within or among the household income categories, and may render direct comparisons between quintiles difficult or even impossible.
The lapse rate is defined as the rate of decrease with height for an atmospheric variable.
The variable involved is temperature unless specified otherwise.
The terminology arises from the word lapse in the sense of a decrease or decline.
While most often applied to Earth 's atmosphere the concept can be extended to any gravitationally supported ball of gas.

Section 8 housing in the South Bronx
Section 8 of the Housing Act of 1937 ( ), often simply known as Section 8, as repeatedly amended, authorizes the payment of rental housing assistance to private landlords on behalf of approximately 3.1 million low-income households.
It operates through several programs, the largest of which, the Housing Choice Voucher program, pays a large portion of the rents and utilities of about 2.1 million households.
The US Department of Housing and Urban Development manages the Section 8 programs.
The Housing Choice Voucher Program provides `` tenant-based '' rental assistance, so a tenant can move from one unit of at least minimum housing quality to another.
It also allows individuals to apply their monthly voucher towards the purchase of a home, with over $ 17 billion going towards such purchases each year ( from ncsha.org analysis ).
The maximum allowed voucher is $ 2200 a month.
Section 8 also authorizes a variety of `` project-based '' rental assistance programs, under which the owner reserves some or all of the units in a building for low-income tenants, in return for a Federal government guarantee to make up the difference between the tenant 's contribution and the rent for 1 cent in the owner 's contract with the government.
A tenant who leaves a subsidized project will lose access to the project-based subsidy.
The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Veterans Affairs have a special Section 8 program called VASH ( Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing ), or HUD-VASH, which gives out a certain number of Section 8 vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable US armed forces veterans.
